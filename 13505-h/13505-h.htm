      THE DUEL

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was eight
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;the time when the officers, the local
      officials, and the visitors usually took their morning dip in the sea
      after the hot, stifling night, and then went into the pavilion to drink
      tea or coffee. Ivan Andreitch Laevsky, a thin, fair young man of
      twenty-eight, wearing the cap of a clerk in the Ministry of Finance and
      with slippers on his feet, coming down to bathe, found a number of
      acquaintances on the beach, and among them his friend Samoylenko, the army
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his big cropped head, short neck, his red face, his big nose, his
      shaggy black eyebrows and grey whiskers, his stout puffy figure and his
      hoarse military bass, this Samoylenko made on every newcomer the
      unpleasant impression of a gruff bully; but two or three days after making
      his acquaintance, one began to think his face extraordinarily
      good-natured, kind, and even handsome. In spite of his clumsiness and
      rough manner, he was a peaceable man, of infinite kindliness and goodness
      of heart, always ready to be of use. He was on familiar terms with every
      one in the town, lent every one money, doctored every one, made matches,
      patched up quarrels, arranged picnics at which he cooked <i>shashlik</i>
      and an awfully good soup of grey mullets. He was always looking after
      other people&rsquo;s affairs and trying to interest some one on their behalf,
      and was always delighted about something. The general opinion about him
      was that he was without faults of character. He had only two weaknesses:
      he was ashamed of his own good nature, and tried to disguise it by a surly
      expression and an assumed gruffness; and he liked his assistants and his
      soldiers to call him &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; although he was only a civil
      councillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer one question for me, Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; Laevsky began, when both
      he and Samoylenko were in the water up to their shoulders. &ldquo;Suppose you
      had loved a woman and had been living with her for two or three years, and
      then left off caring for her, as one does, and began to feel that you had
      nothing in common with her. How would you behave in that case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. &lsquo;You go where you please, madam&rsquo;&mdash;and that would
      be the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to say that! But if she has nowhere to go? A woman with no
      friends or relations, without a farthing, who can&rsquo;t work . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Five hundred roubles down or an allowance of twenty-five roubles a
      month&mdash;and nothing more. It&rsquo;s very simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even supposing you have five hundred roubles and can pay twenty-five
      roubles a month, the woman I am speaking of is an educated woman and
      proud. Could you really bring yourself to offer her money? And how would
      you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko was going to answer, but at that moment a big wave covered them
      both, then broke on the beach and rolled back noisily over the shingle.
      The friends got out and began dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it is difficult to live with a woman if you don&rsquo;t love her,&rdquo;
       said Samoylenko, shaking the sand out of his boots. &ldquo;But one must look at
      the thing humanely, Vanya. If it were my case, I should never show a sign
      that I did not love her, and I should go on living with her till I died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at once ashamed of his own words; he pulled himself up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for aught I care, there might be no females at all. Let them all go
      to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friends dressed and went into the pavilion. There Samoylenko was quite
      at home, and even had a special cup and saucer. Every morning they brought
      him on a tray a cup of coffee, a tall cut glass of iced water, and a tiny
      glass of brandy. He would first drink the brandy, then the hot coffee,
      then the iced water, and this must have been very nice, for after drinking
      it his eyes looked moist with pleasure, he would stroke his whiskers with
      both hands, and say, looking at the sea:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wonderfully magnificent view!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long night spent in cheerless, unprofitable thoughts which
      prevented him from sleeping, and seemed to intensify the darkness and
      sultriness of the night, Laevsky felt listless and shattered. He felt no
      better for the bathe and the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on with our talk, Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make a
      secret of it; I&rsquo;ll speak to you openly as to a friend. Things are in a bad
      way with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and me . . . a very bad way! Forgive me for
      forcing my private affairs upon you, but I must speak out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko, who had a misgiving of what he was going to speak about,
      dropped his eyes and drummed with his fingers on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived with her for two years and have ceased to love her,&rdquo; Laevsky
      went on; &ldquo;or, rather, I realised that I never had felt any love for her. .
      . . These two years have been a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Laevsky&rsquo;s habit as he talked to gaze attentively at the pink palms
      of his hands, to bite his nails, or to pinch his cuffs. And he did so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very well you can&rsquo;t help me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I tell you, because
      unsuccessful and superfluous people like me find their salvation in
      talking. I have to generalise about everything I do. I&rsquo;m bound to look for
      an explanation and justification of my absurd existence in somebody else&rsquo;s
      theories, in literary types&mdash;in the idea that we, upper-class
      Russians, are degenerating, for instance, and so on. Last night, for
      example, I comforted myself by thinking all the time: &lsquo;Ah, how true
      Tolstoy is, how mercilessly true!&rsquo; And that did me good. Yes, really,
      brother, he is a great writer, say what you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko, who had never read Tolstoy and was intending to do so every
      day of his life, was a little embarrassed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all other authors write from imagination, but he writes straight
      from nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; sighed Laevsky; &ldquo;how distorted we all are by civilisation! I
      fell in love with a married woman and she with me. . . . To begin with, we
      had kisses, and calm evenings, and vows, and Spencer, and ideals, and
      interests in common. . . . What a deception! We really ran away from her
      husband, but we lied to ourselves and made out that we ran away from the
      emptiness of the life of the educated class. We pictured our future like
      this: to begin with, in the Caucasus, while we were getting to know the
      people and the place, I would put on the Government uniform and enter the
      service; then at our leisure we would pick out a plot of ground, would
      toil in the sweat of our brow, would have a vineyard and a field, and so
      on. If you were in my place, or that zoologist of yours, Von Koren, you
      might live with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for thirty years, perhaps, and might
      leave your heirs a rich vineyard and three thousand acres of maize; but I
      felt like a bankrupt from the first day. In the town you have insufferable
      heat, boredom, and no society; if you go out into the country, you fancy
      poisonous spiders, scorpions, or snakes lurking under every stone and
      behind every bush, and beyond the fields&mdash;mountains and the desert.
      Alien people, an alien country, a wretched form of civilisation&mdash;all
      that is not so easy, brother, as walking on the Nevsky Prospect in one&rsquo;s
      fur coat, arm-in-arm with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, dreaming of the sunny
      South. What is needed here is a life and death struggle, and I&rsquo;m not a
      fighting man. A wretched neurasthenic, an idle gentleman . . . . From the
      first day I knew that my dreams of a life of labour and of a vineyard were
      worthless. As for love, I ought to tell you that living with a woman who
      has read Spencer and has followed you to the ends of the earth is no more
      interesting than living with any Anfissa or Akulina. There&rsquo;s the same
      smell of ironing, of powder, and of medicines, the same curl-papers every
      morning, the same self-deception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get on in the house without an iron,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, blushing
      at Laevsky&rsquo;s speaking to him so openly of a lady he knew. &ldquo;You are out of
      humour to-day, Vanya, I notice. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is a splendid woman,
      highly educated, and you are a man of the highest intellect. Of course,
      you are not married,&rdquo; Samoylenko went on, glancing round at the adjacent
      tables, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not your fault; and besides . . . one ought to be
      above conventional prejudices and rise to the level of modern ideas. I
      believe in free love myself, yes. . . . But to my thinking, once you have
      settled together, you ought to go on living together all your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you directly,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;Eight years ago there was an
      old fellow, an agent, here&mdash;a man of very great intelligence. Well,
      he used to say that the great thing in married life was patience. Do you
      hear, Vanya? Not love, but patience. Love cannot last long. You have lived
      two years in love, and now evidently your married life has reached the
      period when, in order to preserve equilibrium, so to speak, you ought to
      exercise all your patience. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe in your old agent; to me his words are meaningless. Your old
      man could be a hypocrite; he could exercise himself in the virtue of
      patience, and, as he did so, look upon a person he did not love as an
      object indispensable for his moral exercises; but I have not yet fallen so
      low. If I want to exercise myself in patience, I will buy dumb-bells or a
      frisky horse, but I&rsquo;ll leave human beings alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko asked for some white wine with ice. When they had drunk a glass
      each, Laevsky suddenly asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, please, what is the meaning of softening of the brain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I explain it to you? . . . It&rsquo;s a disease in which the brain
      becomes softer . . . as it were, dissolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it curable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if the disease is not neglected. Cold douches, blisters. . . .
      Something internal, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! . . . Well, you see my position; I can&rsquo;t live with her: it is more
      than I can do. While I&rsquo;m with you I can be philosophical about it and
      smile, but at home I lose heart completely; I am so utterly miserable,
      that if I were told, for instance, that I should have to live another
      month with her, I should blow out my brains. At the same time, parting
      with her is out of the question. She has no friends or relations; she
      cannot work, and neither she nor I have any money. . . . What could become
      of her? To whom could she go? There is nothing one can think of. . . .
      Come, tell me, what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . .&rdquo; growled Samoylenko, not knowing what to answer. &ldquo;Does she
      love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she loves me in so far as at her age and with her temperament she
      wants a man. It would be as difficult for her to do without me as to do
      without her powder or her curl-papers. I am for her an indispensable,
      integral part of her boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko was embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out of humour to-day, Vanya,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must have had a bad
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I slept badly. . . . Altogether, I feel horribly out of sorts,
      brother. My head feels empty; there&rsquo;s a sinking at my heart, a weakness. .
      . . I must run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, to the North. To the pines and the mushrooms, to people and ideas.
      . . . I&rsquo;d give half my life to bathe now in some little stream in the
      province of Moscow or Tula; to feel chilly, you know, and then to stroll
      for three hours even with the feeblest student, and to talk and talk
      endlessly. . . . And the scent of the hay! Do you remember it? And in the
      evening, when one walks in the garden, sounds of the piano float from the
      house; one hears the train passing. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky laughed with pleasure; tears came into his eyes, and to cover
      them, without getting up, he stretched across the next table for the
      matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been in Russia for eighteen years,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten what it is like. To my mind, there is not a country more
      splendid than the Caucasus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vereshtchagin has a picture in which some men condemned to death are
      languishing at the bottom of a very deep well. Your magnificent Caucasus
      strikes me as just like that well. If I were offered the choice of a
      chimney-sweep in Petersburg or a prince in the Caucasus, I should choose
      the job of chimney-sweep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky grew pensive. Looking at his stooping figure, at his eyes fixed
      dreamily at one spot, at his pale, perspiring face and sunken temples, at
      his bitten nails, at the slipper which had dropped off his heel,
      displaying a badly darned sock, Samoylenko was moved to pity, and probably
      because Laevsky reminded him of a helpless child, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your mother living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we are on bad terms. She could not forgive me for this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko was fond of his friend. He looked upon Laevsky as a
      good-natured fellow, a student, a man with no nonsense about him, with
      whom one could drink, and laugh, and talk without reserve. What he
      understood in him he disliked extremely. Laevsky drank a great deal and at
      unsuitable times; he played cards, despised his work, lived beyond his
      means, frequently made use of unseemly expressions in conversation, walked
      about the streets in his slippers, and quarrelled with Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna before other people&mdash;and Samoylenko did not like this. But
      the fact that Laevsky had once been a student in the Faculty of Arts,
      subscribed to two fat reviews, often talked so cleverly that only a few
      people understood him, was living with a well-educated woman&mdash;all
      this Samoylenko did not understand, and he liked this and respected
      Laevsky, thinking him superior to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another point,&rdquo; said Laevsky, shaking his head. &ldquo;Only it is
      between ourselves. I&rsquo;m concealing it from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for the
      time. . . . Don&rsquo;t let it out before her. . . . I got a letter the day
      before yesterday, telling me that her husband has died from softening of
      the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven be his!&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko. &ldquo;Why are you concealing
      it from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To show her that letter would be equivalent to &lsquo;Come to church to be
      married.&rsquo; And we should first have to make our relations clear. When she
      understands that we can&rsquo;t go on living together, I will show her the
      letter. Then there will be no danger in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what, Vanya,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, and a sad and imploring
      expression came into his face, as though he were going to ask him about
      something very touching and were afraid of being refused. &ldquo;Marry her, my
      dear boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your duty to that splendid woman! Her husband is dead, and so
      Providence itself shows you what to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do understand, you queer fellow, that it is impossible. To marry
      without love is as base and unworthy of a man as to perform mass without
      believing in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s your duty to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it my duty?&rdquo; Laevsky asked irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you took her away from her husband and made yourself responsible
      for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I tell you in plain Russian, I don&rsquo;t love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ve no love, show her proper respect, consider her wishes. .
      . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Show her respect, consider her wishes,&rsquo;&rdquo; Laevsky mimicked him. &ldquo;As
      though she were some Mother Superior! . . . You are a poor psychologist
      and physiologist if you think that living with a woman one can get off
      with nothing but respect and consideration. What a woman thinks most of is
      her bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanya, Vanya!&rdquo; said Samoylenko, overcome with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an elderly child, a theorist, while I am an old man in spite of
      my years, and practical, and we shall never understand one another. We had
      better drop this conversation. Mustapha!&rdquo; Laevsky shouted to the waiter.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no . . .&rdquo; the doctor cried in dismay, clutching Laevsky&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;It is
      for me to pay. I ordered it. Make it out to me,&rdquo; he cried to Mustapha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends got up and walked in silence along the sea-front. When they
      reached the boulevard, they stopped and shook hands at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are awfully spoilt, my friend!&rdquo; Samoylenko sighed. &ldquo;Fate has sent you
      a young, beautiful, cultured woman, and you refuse the gift, while if God
      were to give me a crooked old woman, how pleased I should be if only she
      were kind and affectionate! I would live with her in my vineyard and . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko caught himself up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she might get the samovar ready for me there, the old hag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After parting with Laevsky he walked along the boulevard. When, bulky and
      majestic, with a stern expression on his face, he walked along the
      boulevard in his snow-white tunic and superbly polished boots, squaring
      his chest, decorated with the Vladimir cross on a ribbon, he was very much
      pleased with himself, and it seemed as though the whole world were looking
      at him with pleasure. Without turning his head, he looked to each side and
      thought that the boulevard was extremely well laid out; that the young
      cypress-trees, the eucalyptuses, and the ugly, anemic palm-trees were very
      handsome and would in time give abundant shade; that the Circassians were
      an honest and hospitable people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that Laevsky does not like the Caucasus,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;very
      strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five soldiers, carrying rifles, met him and saluted him. On the right side
      of the boulevard the wife of a local official was walking along the
      pavement with her son, a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Marya Konstantinovna,&rdquo; Samoylenko shouted to her with a
      pleasant smile. &ldquo;Have you been to bathe? Ha, ha, ha! . . . My respects to
      Nikodim Alexandritch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went on, still smiling pleasantly, but seeing an assistant of the
      military hospital coming towards him, he suddenly frowned, stopped him,
      and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any one in the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, Your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, Your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, run along. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swaying majestically, he made for the lemonade stall, where sat a
      full-bosomed old Jewess, who gave herself out to be a Georgian, and said
      to her as loudly as though he were giving the word of command to a
      regiment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so good as to give me some soda-water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Laevsky&rsquo;s not loving Nadyezhda Fyodorovna showed itself chiefly in the
      fact that everything she said or did seemed to him a lie, or equivalent to
      a lie, and everything he read against women and love seemed to him to
      apply perfectly to himself, to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and her husband. When
      he returned home, she was sitting at the window, dressed and with her hair
      done, and with a preoccupied face was drinking coffee and turning over the
      leaves of a fat magazine; and he thought the drinking of coffee was not
      such a remarkable event that she need put on a preoccupied expression over
      it, and that she had been wasting her time doing her hair in a fashionable
      style, as there was no one here to attract and no need to be attractive.
      And in the magazine he saw nothing but falsity. He thought she had dressed
      and done her hair so as to look handsomer, and was reading in order to
      seem clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be all right for me to go to bathe to-day?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? There won&rsquo;t be an earthquake whether you go or not, I suppose . . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I only ask in case the doctor should be vexed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ask the doctor, then; I&rsquo;m not a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion what displeased Laevsky most in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was
      her white open neck and the little curls at the back of her head. And he
      remembered that when Anna Karenin got tired of her husband, what she
      disliked most of all was his ears, and thought: &ldquo;How true it is, how
      true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling weak and as though his head were perfectly empty, he went into his
      study, lay down on his sofa, and covered his face with a handkerchief that
      he might not be bothered by the flies. Despondent and oppressive thoughts
      always about the same thing trailed slowly across his brain like a long
      string of waggons on a gloomy autumn evening, and he sank into a state of
      drowsy oppression. It seemed to him that he had wronged Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna and her husband, and that it was through his fault that her
      husband had died. It seemed to him that he had sinned against his own
      life, which he had ruined, against the world of lofty ideas, of learning,
      and of work, and he conceived that wonderful world as real and possible,
      not on this sea-front with hungry Turks and lazy mountaineers sauntering
      upon it, but there in the North, where there were operas, theatres,
      newspapers, and all kinds of intellectual activity. One could only there&mdash;not
      here&mdash;be honest, intelligent, lofty, and pure. He accused himself of
      having no ideal, no guiding principle in life, though he had a dim
      understanding now what it meant. Two years before, when he fell in love
      with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, it seemed to him that he had only to go with
      her as his wife to the Caucasus, and he would be saved from vulgarity and
      emptiness; in the same way now, he was convinced that he had only to part
      from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and to go to Petersburg, and he would get
      everything he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, sitting up and biting his nails. &ldquo;Run
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pictured in his imagination how he would go aboard the steamer and then
      would have some lunch, would drink some cold beer, would talk on deck with
      ladies, then would get into the train at Sevastopol and set off. Hurrah
      for freedom! One station after another would flash by, the air would keep
      growing colder and keener, then the birches and the fir-trees, then Kursk,
      Moscow. . . . In the restaurants cabbage soup, mutton with kasha,
      sturgeon, beer, no more Asiaticism, but Russia, real Russia. The
      passengers in the train would talk about trade, new singers, the
      Franco-Russian <i>entente</i>; on all sides there would be the feeling of
      keen, cultured, intellectual, eager life. . . . Hasten on, on! At last
      Nevsky Prospect, and Great Morskaya Street, and then Kovensky Place, where
      he used to live at one time when he was a student, the dear grey sky, the
      drizzling rain, the drenched cabmen. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivan Andreitch!&rdquo; some one called from the next room. &ldquo;Are you at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Laevsky responded. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky got up languidly, feeling giddy, walked into the other room,
      yawning and shuffling with his slippers. There, at the open window that
      looked into the street, stood one of his young fellow-clerks, laying out
      some government documents on the window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Laevsky said softly, and he went to look for
      the ink; returning to the window, he signed the papers without looking at
      them, and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you coming to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. . . . I&rsquo;m not quite well. Tell Sheshkovsky that I will
      come and see him after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk went away. Laevsky lay down on his sofa again and began
      thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I must weigh all the circumstances and reflect on them. Before I
      go away from here I ought to pay up my debts. I owe about two thousand
      roubles. I have no money. . . . Of course, that&rsquo;s not important; I shall
      pay part now, somehow, and I shall send the rest, later, from Petersburg.
      The chief point is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. . . . First of all we must define
      our relations. . . . Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later he was considering whether it would not be better to go to
      Samoylenko for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might go,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but what use would there be in it? I shall only
      say something inappropriate about boudoirs, about women, about what is
      honest or dishonest. What&rsquo;s the use of talking about what is honest or
      dishonest, if I must make haste to save my life, if I am suffocating in
      this cursed slavery and am killing myself? . . . One must realise at last
      that to go on leading the life I do is something so base and so cruel that
      everything else seems petty and trivial beside it. To run away,&rdquo; he
      muttered, sitting down, &ldquo;to run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deserted seashore, the insatiable heat, and the monotony of the smoky
      lilac mountains, ever the same and silent, everlastingly solitary,
      overwhelmed him with depression, and, as it were, made him drowsy and
      sapped his energy. He was perhaps very clever, talented, remarkably
      honest; perhaps if the sea and the mountains had not closed him in on all
      sides, he might have become an excellent Zemstvo leader, a statesman, an
      orator, a political writer, a saint. Who knows? If so, was it not stupid
      to argue whether it were honest or dishonest when a gifted and useful man&mdash;an
      artist or musician, for instance&mdash;to escape from prison, breaks a
      wall and deceives his jailers? Anything is honest when a man is in such a
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down to dinner. When
      the cook gave them rice and tomato soup, Laevsky said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same thing every day. Why not have cabbage soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no cabbages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange. Samoylenko has cabbage soup and Marya Konstantinovna has
      cabbage soup, and only I am obliged to eat this mawkish mess. We can&rsquo;t go
      on like this, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As is common with the vast majority of husbands and wives, not a single
      dinner had in earlier days passed without scenes and fault-finding between
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Laevsky; but ever since Laevsky had made up his
      mind that he did not love her, he had tried to give way to Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna in everything, spoke to her gently and politely, smiled, and
      called her &ldquo;darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This soup tastes like liquorice,&rdquo; he said, smiling; he made an effort to
      control himself and seem amiable, but could not refrain from saying:
      &ldquo;Nobody looks after the housekeeping. . . . If you are too ill or busy
      with reading, let me look after the cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In earlier days she would have said to him, &ldquo;Do by all means,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I see
      you want to turn me into a cook&rdquo;; but now she only looked at him timidly
      and flushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you feel to-day?&rdquo; he asked kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all right to-day. There is nothing but a little weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take care of yourself, darling. I am awfully anxious about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was ill in some way. Samoylenko said she had
      intermittent fever, and gave her quinine; the other doctor, Ustimovitch, a
      tall, lean, unsociable man, who used to sit at home in the daytime, and in
      the evenings walk slowly up and down on the sea-front coughing, with his
      hands folded behind him and a cane stretched along his back, was of
      opinion that she had a female complaint, and prescribed warm compresses.
      In old days, when Laevsky loved her, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s illness had
      excited his pity and terror; now he saw falsity even in her illness. Her
      yellow, sleepy face, her lustreless eyes, her apathetic expression, and
      the yawning that always followed her attacks of fever, and the fact that
      during them she lay under a shawl and looked more like a boy than a woman,
      and that it was close and stuffy in her room&mdash;all this, in his
      opinion, destroyed the illusion and was an argument against love and
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next dish given him was spinach with hard-boiled eggs, while Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, as an invalid, had jelly and milk. When with a preoccupied
      face she touched the jelly with a spoon and then began languidly eating
      it, sipping milk, and he heard her swallowing, he was possessed by such an
      overwhelming aversion that it made his head tingle. He recognised that
      such a feeling would be an insult even to a dog, but he was angry, not
      with himself but with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, for arousing such a feeling,
      and he understood why lovers sometimes murder their mistresses. He would
      not murder her, of course, but if he had been on a jury now, he would have
      acquitted the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci, darling,&rdquo; he said after dinner, and kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on
      the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back into his study, he spent five minutes in walking to and fro,
      looking at his boots; then he sat down on his sofa and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away, run away! We must define the position and run away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay down on the sofa and recalled again that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s
      husband had died, perhaps, by his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To blame a man for loving a woman, or ceasing to love a woman, is
      stupid,&rdquo; he persuaded himself, lying down and raising his legs in order to
      put on his high boots. &ldquo;Love and hatred are not under our control. As for
      her husband, maybe I was in an indirect way one of the causes of his
      death; but again, is it my fault that I fell in love with his wife and she
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he got up, and finding his cap, set off to the lodgings of his
      colleague, Sheshkovsky, where the Government clerks met every day to play
      <i>vint</i> and drink beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My indecision reminds me of Hamlet,&rdquo; thought Laevsky on the way. &ldquo;How
      truly Shakespeare describes it! Ah, how truly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      For the sake of sociability and from sympathy for the hard plight of
      newcomers without families, who, as there was not an hotel in the town,
      had nowhere to dine, Dr. Samoylenko kept a sort of table d&rsquo;hôte. At this
      time there were only two men who habitually dined with him: a young
      zoologist called Von Koren, who had come for the summer to the Black Sea
      to study the embryology of the medusa, and a deacon called Pobyedov, who
      had only just left the seminary and been sent to the town to take the duty
      of the old deacon who had gone away for a cure. Each of them paid twelve
      roubles a month for their dinner and supper, and Samoylenko made them
      promise to turn up at two o&rsquo;clock punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren was usually the first to appear. He sat down in the drawing-room
      in silence, and taking an album from the table, began attentively
      scrutinising the faded photographs of unknown men in full trousers and
      top-hats, and ladies in crinolines and caps. Samoylenko only remembered a
      few of them by name, and of those whom he had forgotten he said with a
      sigh: &ldquo;A very fine fellow, remarkably intelligent!&rdquo; When he had finished
      with the album, Von Koren took a pistol from the whatnot, and screwing up
      his left eye, took deliberate aim at the portrait of Prince Vorontsov, or
      stood still at the looking-glass and gazed a long time at his swarthy
      face, his big forehead, and his black hair, which curled like a negro&rsquo;s,
      and his shirt of dull-coloured cotton with big flowers on it like a
      Persian rug, and the broad leather belt he wore instead of a waistcoat.
      The contemplation of his own image seemed to afford him almost more
      satisfaction than looking at photographs or playing with the pistols. He
      was very well satisfied with his face, and his becomingly clipped beard,
      and the broad shoulders, which were unmistakable evidence of his excellent
      health and physical strength. He was satisfied, too, with his stylish
      get-up, from the cravat, which matched the colour of his shirt, down to
      his brown boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was looking at the album and standing before the glass, at that
      moment, in the kitchen and in the passage near, Samoylenko, without his
      coat and waistcoat, with his neck bare, excited and bathed in
      perspiration, was bustling about the tables, mixing the salad, or making
      some sauce, or preparing meat, cucumbers, and onion for the cold soup,
      while he glared fiercely at the orderly who was helping him, and
      brandished first a knife and then a spoon at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the vinegar!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the vinegar&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      salad oil!&rdquo; he shouted, stamping. &ldquo;Where are you off to, you brute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get the butter, Your Excellency,&rdquo; answered the flustered orderly in a
      cracked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste; it&rsquo;s in the cupboard! And tell Daria to put some fennel in
      the jar with the cucumbers! Fennel! Cover the cream up, gaping laggard, or
      the flies will get into it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the whole house seemed resounding with his shouts. When it was ten or
      fifteen minutes to two the deacon would come in; he was a lanky young man
      of twenty-two, with long hair, with no beard and a hardly perceptible
      moustache. Going into the drawing-room, he crossed himself before the
      ikon, smiled, and held out his hand to Von Koren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; the zoologist said coldly. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been catching sea-gudgeon in the harbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course. . . . Evidently, deacon, you will never be busy with
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Work is not like a bear; it doesn&rsquo;t run off into the woods,&rdquo;
       said the deacon, smiling and thrusting his hands into the very deep
      pockets of his white cassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one to whip you!&rdquo; sighed the zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fifteen or twenty minutes passed and they were not called to
      dinner, and they could still hear the orderly running into the kitchen and
      back again, noisily treading with his boots, and Samoylenko shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it on the table! Where are your wits? Wash it first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The famished deacon and Von Koren began tapping on the floor with their
      heels, expressing in this way their impatience like the audience at a
      theatre. At last the door opened and the harassed orderly announced that
      dinner was ready! In the dining-room they were met by Samoylenko, crimson
      in the face, wrathful, perspiring from the heat of the kitchen; he looked
      at them furiously, and with an expression of horror, took the lid off the
      soup tureen and helped each of them to a plateful; and only when he was
      convinced that they were eating it with relish and liked it, he gave a
      sigh of relief and settled himself in his deep arm-chair. His face looked
      blissful and his eyes grew moist. . . . He deliberately poured himself out
      a glass of vodka and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the health of the younger generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After his conversation with Laevsky, from early morning till dinner
      Samoylenko had been conscious of a load at his heart, although he was in
      the best of humours; he felt sorry for Laevsky and wanted to help him.
      After drinking a glass of vodka before the soup, he heaved a sigh and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Vanya Laevsky to-day. He is having a hard time of it, poor fellow!
      The material side of life is not encouraging for him, and the worst of it
      is all this psychology is too much for him. I&rsquo;m sorry for the lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a person I am not sorry for,&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;If that
      charming individual were drowning, I would push him under with a stick and
      say, &lsquo;Drown, brother, drown away.&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s untrue. You wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo; The zoologist shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
      as capable of a good action as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is drowning a man a good action?&rdquo; asked the deacon, and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laevsky? Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is something amiss with the soup . . .&rdquo; said Samoylenko,
      anxious to change the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laevsky is absolutely pernicious and is as dangerous to society as the
      cholera microbe,&rdquo; Von Koren went on. &ldquo;To drown him would be a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not do you credit to talk like that about your neighbour. Tell
      us: what do you hate him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, doctor. To hate and despise a microbe is stupid, but
      to look upon everybody one meets without distinction as one&rsquo;s neighbour,
      whatever happens&mdash;thanks very much, that is equivalent to giving up
      criticism, renouncing a straightforward attitude to people, washing one&rsquo;s
      hands of responsibility, in fact! I consider your Laevsky a blackguard; I
      do not conceal it, and I am perfectly conscientious in treating him as
      such. Well, you look upon him as your neighbour&mdash;and you may kiss him
      if you like: you look upon him as your neighbour, and that means that your
      attitude to him is the same as to me and to the deacon; that is no
      attitude at all. You are equally indifferent to all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To call a man a blackguard!&rdquo; muttered Samoylenko, frowning with distaste&mdash;&ldquo;that
      is so wrong that I can&rsquo;t find words for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are judged by their actions,&rdquo; Von Koren continued. &ldquo;Now you
      decide, deacon. . . . I am going to talk to you, deacon. Mr. Laevsky&rsquo;s
      career lies open before you, like a long Chinese puzzle, and you can read
      it from beginning to end. What has he been doing these two years that he
      has been living here? We will reckon his doings on our fingers. First, he
      has taught the inhabitants of the town to play <i>vint</i>: two years ago
      that game was unknown here; now they all play it from morning till late at
      night, even the women and the boys. Secondly, he has taught the residents
      to drink beer, which was not known here either; the inhabitants are
      indebted to him for the knowledge of various sorts of spirits, so that now
      they can distinguish Kospelov&rsquo;s vodka from Smirnov&rsquo;s No. 21, blindfold.
      Thirdly, in former days, people here made love to other men&rsquo;s wives in
      secret, from the same motives as thieves steal in secret and not openly;
      adultery was considered something they were ashamed to make a public
      display of. Laevsky has come as a pioneer in that line; he lives with
      another man&rsquo;s wife openly. . . . Fourthly . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren hurriedly ate up his soup and gave his plate to the orderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood Laevsky from the first month of our acquaintance,&rdquo; he went
      on, addressing the deacon. &ldquo;We arrived here at the same time. Men like him
      are very fond of friendship, intimacy, solidarity, and all the rest of it,
      because they always want company for <i>vint</i>, drinking, and eating;
      besides, they are talkative and must have listeners. We made friends&mdash;that
      is, he turned up every day, hindered me working, and indulged in
      confidences in regard to his mistress. From the first he struck me by his
      exceptional falsity, which simply made me sick. As a friend I pitched into
      him, asking him why he drank too much, why he lived beyond his means and
      got into debt, why he did nothing and read nothing, why he had so little
      culture and so little knowledge; and in answer to all my questions he used
      to smile bitterly, sigh, and say: &lsquo;I am a failure, a superfluous man&rsquo;; or:
      &lsquo;What do you expect, my dear fellow, from us, the debris of the
      serf-owning class?&rsquo; or: &lsquo;We are degenerate. . . .&rsquo; Or he would begin a
      long rigmarole about Onyegin, Petchorin, Byron&rsquo;s Cain, and Bazarov, of
      whom he would say: &lsquo;They are our fathers in flesh and in spirit.&rsquo; So we
      are to understand that it was not his fault that Government envelopes lay
      unopened in his office for weeks together, and that he drank and taught
      others to drink, but Onyegin, Petchorin, and Turgenev, who had invented
      the failure and the superfluous man, were responsible for it. The cause of
      his extreme dissoluteness and unseemliness lies, do you see, not in
      himself, but somewhere outside in space. And so&mdash;an ingenious idea!&mdash;it
      is not only he who is dissolute, false, and disgusting, but we . . . &lsquo;we
      men of the eighties,&rsquo; &lsquo;we the spiritless, nervous offspring of the
      serf-owning class&rsquo;; &lsquo;civilisation has crippled us&rsquo; . . . in fact, we are
      to understand that such a great man as Laevsky is great even in his fall:
      that his dissoluteness, his lack of culture and of moral purity, is a
      phenomenon of natural history, sanctified by inevitability; that the
      causes of it are world-wide, elemental; and that we ought to hang up a
      lamp before Laevsky, since he is the fated victim of the age, of
      influences, of heredity, and so on. All the officials and their ladies
      were in ecstasies when they listened to him, and I could not make out for
      a long time what sort of man I had to deal with, a cynic or a clever
      rogue. Such types as he, on the surface intellectual with a smattering of
      education and a great deal of talk about their own nobility, are very
      clever in posing as exceptionally complex natures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; Samoylenko flared up. &ldquo;I will not allow a splendid
      fellow to be spoken ill of in my presence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt, Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; said Von Koren coldly; &ldquo;I am just
      finishing. Laevsky is by no means a complex organism. Here is his moral
      skeleton: in the morning, slippers, a bathe, and coffee; then till
      dinner-time, slippers, a constitutional, and conversation; at two o&rsquo;clock
      slippers, dinner, and wine; at five o&rsquo;clock a bathe, tea and wine, then <i>vint</i>
      and lying; at ten o&rsquo;clock supper and wine; and after midnight sleep and <i>la
      femme</i>. His existence is confined within this narrow programme like an
      egg within its shell. Whether he walks or sits, is angry, writes,
      rejoices, it may all be reduced to wine, cards, slippers, and women. Woman
      plays a fatal, overwhelming part in his life. He tells us himself that at
      thirteen he was in love; that when he was a student in his first year he
      was living with a lady who had a good influence over him, and to whom he
      was indebted for his musical education. In his second year he bought a
      prostitute from a brothel and raised her to his level&mdash;that is, took
      her as his kept mistress, and she lived with him for six months and then
      ran away back to the brothel-keeper, and her flight caused him much
      spiritual suffering. Alas! his sufferings were so great that he had to
      leave the university and spend two years at home doing nothing. But this
      was all for the best. At home he made friends with a widow who advised him
      to leave the Faculty of Jurisprudence and go into the Faculty of Arts. And
      so he did. When he had taken his degree, he fell passionately in love with
      his present . . . what&rsquo;s her name? . . . married lady, and was obliged to
      flee with her here to the Caucasus for the sake of his ideals, he would
      have us believe, seeing that . . . to-morrow, if not to-day, he will be
      tired of her and flee back again to Petersburg, and that, too, will be for
      the sake of his ideals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; growled Samoylenko, looking angrily at the zoologist.
      &ldquo;You had better eat your dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next course consisted of boiled mullet with Polish sauce. Samoylenko
      helped each of his companions to a whole mullet and poured out the sauce
      with his own hand. Two minutes passed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman plays an essential part in the life of every man,&rdquo; said the deacon.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but to what degree? For each of us woman means mother, sister, wife,
      friend. To Laevsky she is everything, and at the same time nothing but a
      mistress. She&mdash;that is, cohabitation with her&mdash; is the happiness
      and object of his life; he is gay, sad, bored, disenchanted&mdash;on
      account of woman; his life grows disagreeable &mdash;woman is to blame;
      the dawn of a new life begins to glow, ideals turn up&mdash;and again look
      for the woman. . . . He only derives enjoyment from books and pictures in
      which there is woman. Our age is, to his thinking, poor and inferior to
      the forties and the sixties only because we do not know how to abandon
      ourselves obviously to the passion and ecstasy of love. These voluptuaries
      must have in their brains a special growth of the nature of sarcoma, which
      stifles the brain and directs their whole psychology. Watch Laevsky when
      he is sitting anywhere in company. You notice: when one raises any general
      question in his presence, for instance, about the cell or instinct, he
      sits apart, and neither speaks nor listens; he looks languid and
      disillusioned; nothing has any interest for him, everything is vulgar and
      trivial. But as soon as you speak of male and female&mdash;for instance,
      of the fact that the female spider, after fertilisation, devours the male&mdash;his
      eyes glow with curiosity, his face brightens, and the man revives, in
      fact. All his thoughts, however noble, lofty, or neutral they may be, they
      all have one point of resemblance. You walk along the street with him and
      meet a donkey, for instance. . . . &lsquo;Tell me, please,&rsquo; he asks, &lsquo;what would
      happen if you mated a donkey with a camel?&rsquo; And his dreams! Has he told
      you of his dreams? It is magnificent! First, he dreams that he is married
      to the moon, then that he is summoned before the police and ordered to
      live with a guitar . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon burst into resounding laughter; Samoylenko frowned and wrinkled
      up his face angrily so as not to laugh, but could not restrain himself,
      and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all nonsense!&rdquo; he said, wiping his tears. &ldquo;Yes, by Jove, it&rsquo;s
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      The deacon was very easily amused, and laughed at every trifle till he got
      a stitch in his side, till he was helpless. It seemed as though he only
      liked to be in people&rsquo;s company because there was a ridiculous side to
      them, and because they might be given ridiculous nicknames. He had
      nicknamed Samoylenko &ldquo;the tarantula,&rdquo; his orderly &ldquo;the drake,&rdquo; and was in
      ecstasies when on one occasion Von Koren spoke of Laevsky and Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna as &ldquo;Japanese monkeys.&rdquo; He watched people&rsquo;s faces greedily,
      listened without blinking, and it could be seen that his eyes filled with
      laughter and his face was tense with expectation of the moment when he
      could let himself go and burst into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a corrupt and depraved type,&rdquo; the zoologist continued, while the
      deacon kept his eyes riveted on his face, expecting he would say something
      funny. &ldquo;It is not often one can meet with such a nonentity. In body he is
      inert, feeble, prematurely old, while in intellect he differs in no
      respect from a fat shopkeeper&rsquo;s wife who does nothing but eat, drink, and
      sleep on a feather-bed, and who keeps her coachman as a lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon began guffawing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, deacon,&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;It grows stupid, at last. I should
      not have paid attention to his insignificance,&rdquo; he went on, after waiting
      till the deacon had left off laughing; &ldquo;I should have passed him by if he
      were not so noxious and dangerous. His noxiousness lies first of all in
      the fact that he has great success with women, and so threatens to leave
      descendants&mdash;that is, to present the world with a dozen Laevskys as
      feeble and as depraved as himself. Secondly, he is in the highest degree
      contaminating. I have spoken to you already of <i>vint</i> and beer. In
      another year or two he will dominate the whole Caucasian coast. You know
      how the mass, especially its middle stratum, believe in intellectuality,
      in a university education, in gentlemanly manners, and in literary
      language. Whatever filthy thing he did, they would all believe that it was
      as it should be, since he is an intellectual man, of liberal ideas and
      university education. What is more, he is a failure, a superfluous man, a
      neurasthenic, a victim of the age, and that means he can do anything. He
      is a charming fellow, a regular good sort, he is so genuinely indulgent to
      human weaknesses; he is compliant, accommodating, easy and not proud; one
      can drink with him and gossip and talk evil of people. . . . The masses,
      always inclined to anthropomorphism in religion and morals, like best of
      all the little gods who have the same weaknesses as themselves. Only think
      what a wide field he has for contamination! Besides, he is not a bad actor
      and is a clever hypocrite, and knows very well how to twist things round.
      Only take his little shifts and dodges, his attitude to civilisation, for
      instance. He has scarcely sniffed at civilisation, yet: &lsquo;Ah, how we have
      been crippled by civilisation! Ah, how I envy those savages, those
      children of nature, who know nothing of civilisation!&rsquo; We are to
      understand, you see, that at one time, in ancient days, he has been
      devoted to civilisation with his whole soul, has served it, has sounded it
      to its depths, but it has exhausted him, disillusioned him, deceived him;
      he is a Faust, do you see?&mdash;a second Tolstoy. . . . As for
      Schopenhauer and Spencer, he treats them like small boys and slaps them on
      the shoulder in a fatherly way: &lsquo;Well, what do you say, old Spencer?&rsquo; He
      has not read Spencer, of course, but how charming he is when with light,
      careless irony he says of his lady friend: &lsquo;She has read Spencer!&rsquo; And
      they all listen to him, and no one cares to understand that this charlatan
      has not the right to kiss the sole of Spencer&rsquo;s foot, let alone speaking
      about him in that tone! Sapping the foundations of civilisation, of
      authority, of other people&rsquo;s altars, spattering them with filth, winking
      jocosely at them only to justify and conceal one&rsquo;s own rottenness and
      moral poverty is only possible for a very vain, base, and nasty creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is you expect of him, Kolya,&rdquo; said Samoylenko,
      looking at the zoologist, not with anger now, but with a guilty air. &ldquo;He
      is a man the same as every one else. Of course, he has his weaknesses, but
      he is abreast of modern ideas, is in the service, is of use to his
      country. Ten years ago there was an old fellow serving as agent here, a
      man of the greatest intelligence . . . and he used to say . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; the zoologist interrupted. &ldquo;You say he is in the
      service; but how does he serve? Do you mean to tell me that things have
      been done better because he is here, and the officials are more punctual,
      honest, and civil? On the contrary, he has only sanctioned their slackness
      by his prestige as an intellectual university man. He is only punctual on
      the 20th of the month, when he gets his salary; on the other days he
      lounges about at home in slippers and tries to look as if he were doing
      the Government a great service by living in the Caucasus. No, Alexandr
      Daviditch, don&rsquo;t stick up for him. You are insincere from beginning to
      end. If you really loved him and considered him your neighbour, you would
      above all not be indifferent to his weaknesses, you would not be indulgent
      to them, but for his own sake would try to make him innocuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Innocuous. Since he is incorrigible, he can only be made innocuous in one
      way. . . .&rdquo; Von Koren passed his finger round his throat. &ldquo;Or he might be
      drowned . . .&rdquo;, he added. &ldquo;In the interests of humanity and in their own
      interests, such people ought to be destroyed. They certainly ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; muttered Samoylenko, getting up and looking with
      amazement at the zoologist&rsquo;s calm, cold face. &ldquo;Deacon, what is he saying?
      Why&mdash;are you in your senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t insist on the death penalty,&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;If it is proved
      that it is pernicious, devise something else. If we can&rsquo;t destroy Laevsky,
      why then, isolate him, make him harmless, send him to hard labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying!&rdquo; said Samoylenko in horror. &ldquo;With pepper, with
      pepper,&rdquo; he cried in a voice of despair, seeing that the deacon was eating
      stuffed aubergines without pepper. &ldquo;You with your great intellect, what
      are you saying! Send our friend, a proud intellectual man, to penal
      servitude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he is proud and tries to resist, put him in fetters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko could not utter a word, and only twiddled his fingers; the
      deacon looked at his flabbergasted and really absurd face, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us leave off talking of that,&rdquo; said the zoologist. &ldquo;Only remember one
      thing, Alexandr Daviditch: primitive man was preserved from such as
      Laevsky by the struggle for existence and by natural selection; now our
      civilisation has considerably weakened the struggle and the selection, and
      we ought to look after the destruction of the rotten and worthless for
      ourselves; otherwise, when the Laevskys multiply, civilisation will perish
      and mankind will degenerate utterly. It will be our fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it depends on drowning and hanging,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, &ldquo;damnation take
      your civilisation, damnation take your humanity! Damnation take it! I tell
      you what: you are a very learned and intelligent man and the pride of your
      country, but the Germans have ruined you. Yes, the Germans! The Germans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Samoylenko had left Dorpat, where he had studied medicine, he had
      rarely seen a German and had not read a single German book, but, in his
      opinion, every harmful idea in politics or science was due to the Germans.
      Where he had got this notion he could not have said himself, but he held
      it firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Germans!&rdquo; he repeated once more. &ldquo;Come and have some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three stood up, and putting on their hats, went out into the little
      garden, and sat there under the shade of the light green maples, the
      pear-trees, and a chestnut-tree. The zoologist and the deacon sat on a
      bench by the table, while Samoylenko sank into a deep wicker chair with a
      sloping back. The orderly handed them tea, jam, and a bottle of syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very hot, thirty degrees Réaumur in the shade. The sultry air was
      stagnant and motionless, and a long spider-web, stretching from the
      chestnut-tree to the ground, hung limply and did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon took up the guitar, which was constantly lying on the ground
      near the table, tuned it, and began singing softly in a thin voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gathered round the tavern were the seminary lads,&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      but instantly subsided, overcome by the heat, mopped his brow and glanced
      upwards at the blazing blue sky. Samoylenko grew drowsy; the sultry heat,
      the stillness and the delicious after-dinner languor, which quickly
      pervaded all his limbs, made him feel heavy and sleepy; his arms dropped
      at his sides, his eyes grew small, his head sank on his breast. He looked
      with almost tearful tenderness at Von Koren and the deacon, and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The younger generation. . . A scientific star and a luminary of the
      Church. . . . I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the long-skirted alleluia will be
      shooting up into a bishop; I dare say I may come to kissing his hand. . .
      . Well . . . please God. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon a snore was heard. Von Koren and the deacon finished their tea and
      went out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the harbour again to catch sea-gudgeon?&rdquo; asked the
      zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see me. You can pack up a parcel and copy something for me. By
      the way, we must have a talk about what you are to do. You must work,
      deacon. You can&rsquo;t go on like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are just and logical,&rdquo; said the deacon. &ldquo;But my laziness finds
      an excuse in the circumstances of my present life. You know yourself that
      an uncertain position has a great tendency to make people apathetic. God
      only knows whether I have been sent here for a time or permanently. I am
      living here in uncertainty, while my wife is vegetating at her father&rsquo;s
      and is missing me. And I must confess my brain is melting with the heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; said the zoologist. &ldquo;You can get used to the heat,
      and you can get used to being without the deaconess. You mustn&rsquo;t be slack;
      you must pull yourself together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went to bathe in the morning, and her cook, Olga,
      followed her with a jug, a copper basin, towels, and a sponge. In the bay
      stood two unknown steamers with dirty white funnels, obviously foreign
      cargo vessels. Some men dressed in white and wearing white shoes were
      walking along the harbour, shouting loudly in French, and were answered
      from the steamers. The bells were ringing briskly in the little church of
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day is Sunday!&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna remembered with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt perfectly well, and was in a gay holiday humour. In a new
      loose-fitting dress of coarse thick tussore silk, and a big wide-brimmed
      straw hat which was bent down over her ears, so that her face looked out
      as though from a basket, she fancied she looked very charming. She thought
      that in the whole town there was only one young, pretty, intellectual
      woman, and that was herself, and that she was the only one who knew how to
      dress herself cheaply, elegantly, and with taste. That dress, for example,
      cost only twenty-two roubles, and yet how charming it was! In the whole
      town she was the only one who could be attractive, while there were
      numbers of men, so they must all, whether they would or not, be envious of
      Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad that of late Laevsky had been cold to her, reserved and
      polite, and at times even harsh and rude; in the past she had met all his
      outbursts, all his contemptuous, cold or strange incomprehensible glances,
      with tears, reproaches, and threats to leave him or to starve herself to
      death; now she only blushed, looked guiltily at him, and was glad he was
      not affectionate to her. If he had abused her, threatened her, it would
      have been better and pleasanter, since she felt hopelessly guilty towards
      him. She felt she was to blame, in the first place, for not sympathising
      with the dreams of a life of hard work, for the sake of which he had given
      up Petersburg and had come here to the Caucasus, and she was convinced
      that he had been angry with her of late for precisely that. When she was
      travelling to the Caucasus, it seemed that she would find here on the
      first day a cosy nook by the sea, a snug little garden with shade, with
      birds, with little brooks, where she could grow flowers and vegetables,
      rear ducks and hens, entertain her neighbours, doctor poor peasants and
      distribute little books amongst them. It had turned out that the Caucasus
      was nothing but bare mountains, forests, and huge valleys, where it took a
      long time and a great deal of effort to find anything and settle down;
      that there were no neighbours of any sort; that it was very hot and one
      might be robbed. Laevsky had been in no hurry to obtain a piece of land;
      she was glad of it, and they seemed to be in a tacit compact never to
      allude to a life of hard work. He was silent about it, she thought,
      because he was angry with her for being silent about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, she had without his knowledge during those two years
      bought various trifles to the value of three hundred roubles at
      Atchmianov&rsquo;s shop. She had bought the things by degrees, at one time
      materials, at another time silk or a parasol, and the debt had grown
      imperceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him about it to-day . . .&rdquo;, she used to decide, but at once
      reflected that in Laevsky&rsquo;s present mood it would hardly be convenient to
      talk to him of debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, she had on two occasions in Laevsky&rsquo;s absence received a visit
      from Kirilin, the police captain: once in the morning when Laevsky had
      gone to bathe, and another time at midnight when he was playing cards.
      Remembering this, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna flushed crimson, and looked round
      at the cook as though she might overhear her thoughts. The long,
      insufferably hot, wearisome days, beautiful languorous evenings and
      stifling nights, and the whole manner of living, when from morning to
      night one is at a loss to fill up the useless hours, and the persistent
      thought that she was the prettiest young woman in the town, and that her
      youth was passing and being wasted, and Laevsky himself, though honest and
      idealistic, always the same, always lounging about in his slippers, biting
      his nails, and wearying her with his caprices, led by degrees to her
      becoming possessed by desire, and as though she were mad, she thought of
      nothing else day and night. Breathing, looking, walking, she felt nothing
      but desire. The sound of the sea told her she must love; the darkness of
      evening&mdash;the same; the mountains&mdash;the same. . . . And when
      Kirilin began paying her attentions, she had neither the power nor the
      wish to resist, and surrendered to him. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the foreign steamers and the men in white reminded her for some reason
      of a huge hall; together with the shouts of French she heard the strains
      of a waltz, and her bosom heaved with unaccountable delight. She longed to
      dance and talk French.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected joyfully that there was nothing terrible about her
      infidelity. Her soul had no part in her infidelity; she still loved
      Laevsky, and that was proved by the fact that she was jealous of him, was
      sorry for him, and missed him when he was away. Kirilin had turned out to
      be very mediocre, rather coarse though handsome; everything was broken off
      with him already and there would never be anything more. What had happened
      was over; it had nothing to do with any one, and if Laevsky found it out
      he would not believe in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one bathing-house for ladies on the sea-front; men bathed
      under the open sky. Going into the bathing-house, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      found there an elderly lady, Marya Konstantinovna Bityugov, and her
      daughter Katya, a schoolgirl of fifteen; both of them were sitting on a
      bench undressing. Marya Konstantinovna was a good-natured, enthusiastic,
      and genteel person, who talked in a drawling and pathetic voice. She had
      been a governess until she was thirty-two, and then had married Bityugov,
      a Government official&mdash;a bald little man with his hair combed on to
      his temples and with a very meek disposition. She was still in love with
      him, was jealous, blushed at the word &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and told every one she was
      very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she cried enthusiastically, on seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      assuming an expression which all her acquaintances called &ldquo;almond-oily.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;My dear, how delightful that you have come! We&rsquo;ll bathe together &mdash;that&rsquo;s
      enchanting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olga quickly flung off her dress and chemise, and began undressing her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite so hot to-day as yesterday?&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      shrinking at the coarse touch of the naked cook. &ldquo;Yesterday I almost died
      of the heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my dear; I could hardly breathe myself. Would you believe it? I
      bathed yesterday three times! Just imagine, my dear, three times! Nikodim
      Alexandritch was quite uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible to be so ugly?&rdquo; thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, looking at
      Olga and the official&rsquo;s wife; she glanced at Katya and thought: &ldquo;The
      little girl&rsquo;s not badly made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Nikodim Alexandritch is very charming!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply in
      love with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; cried Marya Konstantinovna, with a forced laugh; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      quite enchanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Free from her clothes, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt a desire to fly. And it
      seemed to her that if she were to wave her hands she would fly upwards.
      When she was undressed, she noticed that Olga looked scornfully at her
      white body. Olga, a young soldier&rsquo;s wife, was living with her lawful
      husband, and so considered herself superior to her mistress. Marya
      Konstantinovna and Katya were afraid of her, and did not respect her. This
      was disagreeable, and to raise herself in their opinion, Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home, in Petersburg, summer villa life is at its height now. My
      husband and I have so many friends! We ought to go and see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe your husband is an engineer?&rdquo; said Marya Konstantinovna
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking of Laevsky. He has a great many acquaintances. But
      unfortunately his mother is a proud aristocrat, not very intelligent. . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna threw herself into the water without finishing; Marya
      Konstantinovna and Katya made their way in after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are so many conventional ideas in the world,&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      went on, &ldquo;and life is not so easy as it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Konstantinovna, who had been a governess in aristocratic families
      and who was an authority on social matters, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! Would you believe me, my dear, at the Garatynskys&rsquo; I was expected
      to dress for lunch as well as for dinner, so that, like an actress, I
      received a special allowance for my wardrobe in addition to my salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Katya as though to screen her
      daughter from the water that washed the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open doors looking out to the sea they could see some one
      swimming a hundred paces from their bathing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s our Kostya,&rdquo; said Katya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, ach!&rdquo; Marya Konstantinovna cackled in her dismay. &ldquo;Ach, Kostya!&rdquo; she
      shouted, &ldquo;Come back! Kostya, come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kostya, a boy of fourteen, to show off his prowess before his mother and
      sister, dived and swam farther, but began to be exhausted and hurried
      back, and from his strained and serious face it could be seen that he
      could not trust his own strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble one has with these boys, my dear!&rdquo; said Marya Konstantinovna,
      growing calmer. &ldquo;Before you can turn round, he will break his neck. Ah, my
      dear, how sweet it is, and yet at the same time how difficult, to be a
      mother! One&rsquo;s afraid of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna put on her straw hat and dashed out into the open
      sea. She swam some thirty feet and then turned on her back. She could see
      the sea to the horizon, the steamers, the people on the sea-front, the
      town; and all this, together with the sultry heat and the soft,
      transparent waves, excited her and whispered that she must live, live. . .
      . A sailing-boat darted by her rapidly and vigorously, cleaving the waves
      and the air; the man sitting at the helm looked at her, and she liked
      being looked at. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      After bathing, the ladies dressed and went away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fever every alternate day, and yet I don&rsquo;t get thin,&rdquo; said
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, licking her lips, which were salt from the bathe,
      and responding with a smile to the bows of her acquaintances. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
      been plump, and now I believe I&rsquo;m plumper than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, my dear, is constitutional. If, like me, one has no constitutional
      tendency to stoutness, no diet is of any use. . . . But you&rsquo;ve wetted your
      hat, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter; it will dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna saw again the men in white who were walking on the
      sea-front and talking French; and again she felt a sudden thrill of joy,
      and had a vague memory of some big hall in which she had once danced, or
      of which, perhaps, she had once dreamed. And something at the bottom of
      her soul dimly and obscurely whispered to her that she was a pretty,
      common, miserable, worthless woman. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Marya Konstantinovna stopped at her gate and asked her to come in and sit
      down for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, my dear,&rdquo; she said in an imploring voice, and at the same time
      she looked at Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with anxiety and hope; perhaps she
      would refuse and not come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, accepting. &ldquo;You know how I
      love being with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she went into the house. Marya Konstantinovna sat her down and gave
      her coffee, regaled her with milk rolls, then showed her photographs of
      her former pupils, the Garatynskys, who were by now married. She showed
      her, too, the examination reports of Kostya and Katya. The reports were
      very good, but to make them seem even better, she complained, with a sigh,
      how difficult the lessons at school were now. . . . She made much of her
      visitor, and was sorry for her, though at the same time she was harassed
      by the thought that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a corrupting influence
      on the morals of Kostya and Katya, and was glad that her Nikodim
      Alexandritch was not at home. Seeing that in her opinion all men are fond
      of &ldquo;women like that,&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a bad effect on
      Nikodim Alexandritch too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she talked to her visitor, Marya Konstantinovna kept remembering that
      they were to have a picnic that evening, and that Von Koren had
      particularly begged her to say nothing about it to the &ldquo;Japanese monkeys&rdquo;&mdash;that
      is, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; but she dropped a word about it
      unawares, crimsoned, and said in confusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will come too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was agreed to drive about five miles out of town on the road to the
      south, to stop near a <i>duhan</i> at the junction of two streams &mdash;the
      Black River and the Yellow River&mdash;and to cook fish soup. They started
      out soon after five. Foremost of the party in a char-à-banc drove
      Samoylenko and Laevsky; they were followed by Marya Konstantinovna,
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, Katya and Kostya, in a coach with three horses,
      carrying with them the crockery and a basket with provisions. In the next
      carriage came the police captain, Kirilin, and the young Atchmianov, the
      son of the shopkeeper to whom Nadyezhda Fyodorovna owed three hundred
      roubles; opposite them, huddled up on the little seat with his feet tucked
      under him, sat Nikodim Alexandritch, a neat little man with hair combed on
      to his temples. Last of all came Von Koren and the deacon; at the deacon&rsquo;s
      feet stood a basket of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R-r-right!&rdquo; Samoylenko shouted at the top of his voice when he met a cart
      or a mountaineer riding on a donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two years&rsquo; time, when I shall have the means and the people ready, I
      shall set off on an expedition,&rdquo; Von Koren was telling the deacon. &ldquo;I
      shall go by the sea-coast from Vladivostok to the Behring Straits, and
      then from the Straits to the mouth of the Yenisei. We shall make the map,
      study the fauna and the flora, and make detailed geological,
      anthropological, and ethnographical researches. It depends upon you to go
      with me or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man with ties and a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife will let you go; we will provide for her. Better still if you
      were to persuade her for the public benefit to go into a nunnery; that
      would make it possible for you to become a monk, too, and join the
      expedition as a priest. I can arrange it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know your theology well?&rdquo; asked the zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, rather badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . . I can&rsquo;t give you any advice on that score, because I don&rsquo;t
      know much about theology myself. You give me a list of books you need, and
      I will send them to you from Petersburg in the winter. It will be
      necessary for you to read the notes of religious travellers, too; among
      them are some good ethnologists and Oriental scholars. When you are
      familiar with their methods, it will be easier for you to set to work. And
      you needn&rsquo;t waste your time till you get the books; come to me, and we
      will study the compass and go through a course of meteorology. All that&rsquo;s
      indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure . . .&rdquo; muttered the deacon, and he laughed. &ldquo;I was trying to
      get a place in Central Russia, and my uncle, the head priest, promised to
      help me. If I go with you I shall have troubled them for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your hesitation. If you go on being an ordinary
      deacon, who is only obliged to hold a service on holidays, and on the
      other days can rest from work, you will be exactly the same as you are now
      in ten years&rsquo; time, and will have gained nothing but a beard and
      moustache; while on returning from this expedition in ten years&rsquo; time you
      will be a different man, you will be enriched by the consciousness that
      something has been done by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the ladies&rsquo; carriage came shrieks of terror and delight. The
      carriages were driving along a road hollowed in a literally overhanging
      precipitous cliff, and it seemed to every one that they were galloping
      along a shelf on a steep wall, and that in a moment the carriages would
      drop into the abyss. On the right stretched the sea; on the left was a
      rough brown wall with black blotches and red veins and with climbing
      roots; while on the summit stood shaggy fir-trees bent over, as though
      looking down in terror and curiosity. A minute later there were shrieks
      and laughter again: they had to drive under a huge overhanging rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the devil I&rsquo;m coming with you,&rdquo; said Laevsky. &ldquo;How
      stupid and vulgar it is! I want to go to the North, to run away, to
      escape; but here I am, for some reason, going to this stupid picnic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look, what a view!&rdquo; said Samoylenko as the horses turned to the left,
      and the valley of the Yellow River came into sight and the stream itself
      gleamed in the sunlight, yellow, turbid, frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing fine in that, Sasha,&rdquo; answered Laevsky. &ldquo;To be in continual
      ecstasies over nature shows poverty of imagination. In comparison with
      what my imagination can give me, all these streams and rocks are trash,
      and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriages now were by the banks of the stream. The high mountain banks
      gradually grew closer, the valley shrank together and ended in a gorge;
      the rocky mountain round which they were driving had been piled together
      by nature out of huge rocks, pressing upon each other with such terrible
      weight, that Samoylenko could not help gasping every time he looked at
      them. The dark and beautiful mountain was cleft in places by narrow
      fissures and gorges from which came a breath of dewy moisture and mystery;
      through the gorges could be seen other mountains, brown, pink, lilac,
      smoky, or bathed in vivid sunlight. From time to time as they passed a
      gorge they caught the sound of water falling from the heights and
      splashing on the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, the damned mountains!&rdquo; sighed Laevsky. &ldquo;How sick I am of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the place where the Black River falls into the Yellow, and the water
      black as ink stains the yellow and struggles with it, stood the Tatar
      Kerbalay&rsquo;s <i>duhan</i>, with the Russian flag on the roof and with an
      inscription written in chalk: &ldquo;The Pleasant <i>duhan</i>.&rdquo; Near it was a
      little garden, enclosed in a hurdle fence, with tables and chairs set out
      in it, and in the midst of a thicket of wretched thornbushes stood a
      single solitary cypress, dark and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerbalay, a nimble little Tatar in a blue shirt and a white apron, was
      standing in the road, and, holding his stomach, he bowed low to welcome
      the carriages, and smiled, showing his glistening white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Kerbalay,&rdquo; shouted Samoylenko. &ldquo;We are driving on a little
      further, and you take along the samovar and chairs! Look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kerbalay nodded his shaven head and muttered something, and only those
      sitting in the last carriage could hear: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got trout, your
      Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them, bring them!&rdquo; said Von Koren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred paces from the <i>duhan</i> the carriages stopped. Samoylenko
      selected a small meadow round which there were scattered stones convenient
      for sitting on, and a fallen tree blown down by the storm with roots
      overgrown by moss and dry yellow needles. Here there was a fragile wooden
      bridge over the stream, and just opposite on the other bank there was a
      little barn for drying maize, standing on four low piles, and looking like
      the hut on hen&rsquo;s legs in the fairy tale; a little ladder sloped from its
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first impression in all was a feeling that they would never get out of
      that place again. On all sides wherever they looked, the mountains rose up
      and towered above them, and the shadows of evening were stealing rapidly,
      rapidly from the <i>duhan</i> and dark cypress, making the narrow winding
      valley of the Black River narrower and the mountains higher. They could
      hear the river murmuring and the unceasing chirrup of the grasshoppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enchanting!&rdquo; said Marya Konstantinovna, heaving deep sighs of ecstasy.
      &ldquo;Children, look how fine! What peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it really is fine,&rdquo; assented Laevsky, who liked the view, and for
      some reason felt sad as he looked at the sky and then at the blue smoke
      rising from the chimney of the <i>duhan</i>. &ldquo;Yes, it is fine,&rdquo; he
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivan Andreitch, describe this view,&rdquo; Marya Konstantinovna said tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Laevsky. &ldquo;The impression is better than any description. The
      wealth of sights and sounds which every one receives from nature by direct
      impression is ranted about by authors in a hideous and unrecognisable
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Von Koren asked coldly, choosing the biggest stone by the side
      of the water, and trying to clamber up and sit upon it. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he
      repeated, looking directly at Laevsky. &ldquo;What of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;? Or,
      for instance, Pushkin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Night in the Ukraine&rsquo;? Nature ought to come and
      bow down at their feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Laevsky, who was too lazy to think and oppose him. &ldquo;Though
      what is &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; after all?&rdquo; he added after a short pause. &ldquo;The
      beauty of poetry and holiness of love are simply the roses under which
      they try to hide its rottenness. Romeo is just the same sort of animal as
      all the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever one talks to you about, you always bring it round to . . .&rdquo; Von
      Koren glanced round at Katya and broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I bring it round to?&rdquo; asked Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One tells you, for instance, how beautiful a bunch of grapes is, and you
      answer: &lsquo;Yes, but how ugly it is when it is chewed and digested in one&rsquo;s
      stomach!&rsquo; Why say that? It&rsquo;s not new, and . . . altogether it is a queer
      habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky knew that Von Koren did not like him, and so was afraid of him,
      and felt in his presence as though every one were constrained and some one
      were standing behind his back. He made no answer and walked away, feeling
      sorry he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, quick march for brushwood for the fire!&rdquo; commanded Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all wandered off in different directions, and no one was left but
      Kirilin, Atchmianov, and Nikodim Alexandritch. Kerbalay brought chairs,
      spread a rug on the ground, and set a few bottles of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police captain, Kirilin, a tall, good-looking man, who in all weathers
      wore his great-coat over his tunic, with his haughty deportment, stately
      carriage, and thick, rather hoarse voice, looked like a young provincial
      chief of police; his expression was mournful and sleepy, as though he had
      just been waked against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you brought this for, you brute?&rdquo; he asked Kerbalay,
      deliberately articulating each word. &ldquo;I ordered you to give us <i>kvarel</i>,
      and what have you brought, you ugly Tatar? Eh? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have plenty of wine of our own, Yegor Alekseitch,&rdquo; Nikodim
      Alexandritch observed, timidly and politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? But I want us to have my wine, too; I&rsquo;m taking part in the picnic
      and I imagine I have full right to contribute my share. I im-ma-gine so!
      Bring ten bottles of <i>kvarel</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so many?&rdquo; asked Nikodim Alexandritch, in wonder, knowing Kirilin had
      no money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty bottles! Thirty!&rdquo; shouted Kirilin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, let him,&rdquo; Atchmianov whispered to Nikodim Alexandritch; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was in a light-hearted, mischievous mood; she wanted
      to skip and jump, to laugh, to shout, to tease, to flirt. In her cheap
      cotton dress with blue pansies on it, in her red shoes and the same straw
      hat, she seemed to herself, little, simple, light, ethereal as a
      butterfly. She ran over the rickety bridge and looked for a minute into
      the water, in order to feel giddy; then, shrieking and laughing, ran to
      the other side to the drying-shed, and she fancied that all the men were
      admiring her, even Kerbalay. When in the rapidly falling darkness the
      trees began to melt into the mountains and the horses into the carriages,
      and a light gleamed in the windows of the <i>duhan</i>, she climbed up the
      mountain by the little path which zigzagged between stones and
      thorn-bushes and sat on a stone. Down below, the camp-fire was burning.
      Near the fire, with his sleeves tucked up, the deacon was moving to and
      fro, and his long black shadow kept describing a circle round it; he put
      on wood, and with a spoon tied to a long stick he stirred the cauldron.
      Samoylenko, with a copper-red face, was fussing round the fire just as
      though he were in his own kitchen, shouting furiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the salt, gentlemen? I bet you&rsquo;ve forgotten it. Why are you all
      sitting about like lords while I do the work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky and Nikodim Alexandritch were sitting side by side on the fallen
      tree looking pensively at the fire. Marya Konstantinovna, Katya, and
      Kostya were taking the cups, saucers, and plates out of the baskets. Von
      Koren, with his arms folded and one foot on a stone, was standing on a
      bank at the very edge of the water, thinking about something. Patches of
      red light from the fire moved together with the shadows over the ground
      near the dark human figures, and quivered on the mountain, on the trees,
      on the bridge, on the drying-shed; on the other side the steep,
      scooped-out bank was all lighted up and glimmering in the stream, and the
      rushing turbid water broke its reflection into little bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon went for the fish which Kerbalay was cleaning and washing on
      the bank, but he stood still half-way and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, how nice it is!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;People, rocks, the fire, the
      twilight, a monstrous tree&mdash;nothing more, and yet how fine it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the further bank some unknown persons made their appearance near the
      drying-shed. The flickering light and the smoke from the camp-fire puffing
      in that direction made it impossible to get a full view of them all at
      once, but glimpses were caught now of a shaggy hat and a grey beard, now
      of a blue shirt, now of a figure, ragged from shoulder to knee, with a
      dagger across the body; then a swarthy young face with black eyebrows, as
      thick and bold as though they had been drawn in charcoal. Five of them sat
      in a circle on the ground, and the other five went into the drying-shed.
      One was standing at the door with his back to the fire, and with his hands
      behind his back was telling something, which must have been very
      interesting, for when Samoylenko threw on twigs and the fire flared up,
      and scattered sparks and threw a glaring light on the shed, two calm
      countenances with an expression on them of deep attention could be seen,
      looking out of the door, while those who were sitting in a circle turned
      round and began listening to the speaker. Soon after, those sitting in a
      circle began softly singing something slow and melodious, that sounded
      like Lenten Church music. . . . Listening to them, the deacon imagined how
      it would be with him in ten years&rsquo; time, when he would come back from the
      expedition: he would be a young priest and monk, an author with a name and
      a splendid past; he would be consecrated an archimandrite, then a bishop;
      and he would serve mass in the cathedral; in a golden mitre he would come
      out into the body of the church with the ikon on his breast, and blessing
      the mass of the people with the triple and the double candelabra, would
      proclaim: &ldquo;Look down from Heaven, O God, behold and visit this vineyard
      which Thy Hand has planted,&rdquo; and the children with their angel voices
      would sing in response: &ldquo;Holy God. . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deacon, where is that fish?&rdquo; he heard Samoylenko&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went back to the fire, the deacon imagined the Church procession
      going along a dusty road on a hot July day; in front the peasants carrying
      the banners and the women and children the ikons, then the boy choristers
      and the sacristan with his face tied up and a straw in his hair, then in
      due order himself, the deacon, and behind him the priest wearing his <i>calotte</i>
      and carrying a cross, and behind them, tramping in the dust, a crowd of
      peasants&mdash;men, women, and children; in the crowd his wife and the
      priest&rsquo;s wife with kerchiefs on their heads. The choristers sing, the
      babies cry, the corncrakes call, the lark carols. . . . Then they make a
      stand and sprinkle the herd with holy water. . . . They go on again, and
      then kneeling pray for rain. Then lunch and talk. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s nice too . . .&rdquo; thought the deacon.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Kirilin and Atchmianov climbed up the mountain by the path. Atchmianov
      dropped behind and stopped, while Kirilin went up to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; he said, touching his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Kirilin, looking at the sky and pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why &lsquo;yes&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna after a brief pause, noticing that
      Atchmianov was watching them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it seems,&rdquo; said the officer, slowly, &ldquo;that our love has withered
      before it has blossomed, so to speak. How do you wish me to understand it?
      Is it a sort of coquetry on your part, or do you look upon me as a
      nincompoop who can be treated as you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mistake! Leave me alone!&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said sharply, on
      that beautiful, marvellous evening, looking at him with terror and asking
      herself with bewilderment, could there really have been a moment when that
      man attracted her and had been near to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Kirilin; he thought in silence for a few minutes and
      said: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll wait till you are in a better humour, and meanwhile I
      venture to assure you I am a gentleman, and I don&rsquo;t allow any one to doubt
      it. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched his cap again and walked off, making his way between the
      bushes. After a short interval Atchmianov approached hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine evening!&rdquo; he said with a slight Armenian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was nice-looking, fashionably dressed, and behaved unaffectedly like a
      well-bred youth, but Nadyezhda Fyodorovna did not like him because she
      owed his father three hundred roubles; it was displeasing to her, too,
      that a shopkeeper had been asked to the picnic, and she was vexed at his
      coming up to her that evening when her heart felt so pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The picnic is a success altogether,&rdquo; he said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, and as though suddenly remembering her debt, she said
      carelessly: &ldquo;Oh, tell them in your shop that Ivan Andreitch will come
      round in a day or two and will pay three hundred roubles . . . . I don&rsquo;t
      remember exactly what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give another three hundred if you would not mention that debt
      every day. Why be prosaic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna laughed; the amusing idea occurred to her that if she
      had been willing and sufficiently immoral she might in one minute be free
      from her debt. If she, for instance, were to turn the head of this
      handsome young fool! How amusing, absurd, wild it would be really! And she
      suddenly felt a longing to make him love her, to plunder him, throw him
      over, and then to see what would come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to give you one piece of advice,&rdquo; Atchmianov said timidly. &ldquo;I
      beg you to beware of Kirilin. He says horrible things about you
      everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t interest me to know what every fool says of me,&rdquo; Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna said coldly, and the amusing thought of playing with handsome
      young Atchmianov suddenly lost its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go down,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re calling us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fish soup was ready by now. They were ladling it out by platefuls, and
      eating it with the religious solemnity with which this is only done at a
      picnic; and every one thought the fish soup very good, and thought that at
      home they had never eaten anything so nice. As is always the case at
      picnics, in the mass of dinner napkins, parcels, useless greasy papers
      fluttering in the wind, no one knew where was his glass or where his
      bread. They poured the wine on the carpet and on their own knees, spilt
      the salt, while it was dark all round them and the fire burnt more dimly,
      and every one was too lazy to get up and put wood on. They all drank wine,
      and even gave Kostya and Katya half a glass each. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      drank one glass and then another, got a little drunk and forgot about
      Kirilin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A splendid picnic, an enchanting evening,&rdquo; said Laevsky, growing lively
      with the wine. &ldquo;But I should prefer a fine winter to all this. &lsquo;His beaver
      collar is silver with hoar-frost.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one to his taste,&rdquo; observed Von Koren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky felt uncomfortable; the heat of the campfire was beating upon his
      back, and the hatred of Von Koren upon his breast and face: this hatred on
      the part of a decent, clever man, a feeling in which there probably lay
      hid a well-grounded reason, humiliated him and enervated him, and unable
      to stand up against it, he said in a propitiatory tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am passionately fond of nature, and I regret that I&rsquo;m not a naturalist.
      I envy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t envy you, and don&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how any one can seriously interest himself in beetles
      and ladybirds while the people are suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky shared her opinion. He was absolutely ignorant of natural science,
      and so could never reconcile himself to the authoritative tone and the
      learned and profound air of the people who devoted themselves to the
      whiskers of ants and the claws of beetles, and he always felt vexed that
      these people, relying on these whiskers, claws, and something they called
      protoplasm (he always imagined it in the form of an oyster), should
      undertake to decide questions involving the origin and life of man. But in
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s words he heard a note of falsity, and simply to
      contradict her he said: &ldquo;The point is not the ladybirds, but the
      deductions made from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was late, eleven o&rsquo;clock, when they began to get into the carriages to
      go home. They took their seats, and the only ones missing were Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna and Atchmianov, who were running after one another, laughing,
      the other side of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, my friends,&rdquo; shouted Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to give ladies wine,&rdquo; said Von Koren in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky, exhausted by the picnic, by the hatred of Von Koren, and by his
      own thoughts, went to meet Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and when, gay and happy,
      feeling light as a feather, breathless and laughing, she took him by both
      hands and laid her head on his breast, he stepped back and said dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are behaving like a . . . cocotte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It sounded horribly coarse, so that he felt sorry for her at once. On his
      angry, exhausted face she read hatred, pity and vexation with himself, and
      her heart sank at once. She realised instantly that she had gone too far,
      had been too free and easy in her behaviour, and overcome with misery,
      feeling herself heavy, stout, coarse, and drunk, she got into the first
      empty carriage together with Atchmianov. Laevsky got in with Kirilin, the
      zoologist with Samoylenko, the deacon with the ladies, and the party set
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what the Japanese monkeys are like,&rdquo; Von Koren began, rolling
      himself up in his cloak and shutting his eyes. &ldquo;You heard she doesn&rsquo;t care
      to take an interest in beetles and ladybirds because the people are
      suffering. That&rsquo;s how all the Japanese monkeys look upon people like us.
      They&rsquo;re a slavish, cunning race, terrified by the whip and the fist for
      ten generations; they tremble and burn incense only before violence; but
      let the monkey into a free state where there&rsquo;s no one to take it by the
      collar, and it relaxes at once and shows itself in its true colours. Look
      how bold they are in picture galleries, in museums, in theatres, or when
      they talk of science: they puff themselves out and get excited, they are
      abusive and critical . . . they are bound to criticise&mdash;it&rsquo;s the sign
      of the slave. You listen: men of the liberal professions are more often
      sworn at than pickpockets&mdash;that&rsquo;s because three-quarters of society
      are made up of slaves, of just such monkeys. It never happens that a slave
      holds out his hand to you and sincerely says &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; to you for your
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you want,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, yawning; &ldquo;the poor thing,
      in the simplicity of her heart, wanted to talk to you of scientific
      subjects, and you draw a conclusion from that. You&rsquo;re cross with him for
      something or other, and with her, too, to keep him company. She&rsquo;s a
      splendid woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, nonsense! An ordinary kept woman, depraved and vulgar. Listen,
      Alexandr Daviditch; when you meet a simple peasant woman, who isn&rsquo;t living
      with her husband, who does nothing but giggle, you tell her to go and
      work. Why are you timid in this case and afraid to tell the truth? Simply
      because Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is kept, not by a sailor, but by an
      official.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do with her?&rdquo; said Samoylenko, getting angry. &ldquo;Beat her or
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not flatter vice. We curse vice only behind its back, and that&rsquo;s like
      making a long nose at it round a corner. I am a zoologist or a
      sociologist, which is the same thing; you are a doctor; society believes
      in us; we ought to point out the terrible harm which threatens it and the
      next generation from the existence of ladies like Nadyezhda Ivanovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fyodorovna,&rdquo; Samoylenko corrected. &ldquo;But what ought society to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society? That&rsquo;s its affair. To my thinking the surest and most direct
      method is&mdash;compulsion. <i>Manu militari</i> she ought to be returned
      to her husband; and if her husband won&rsquo;t take her in, then she ought to be
      sent to penal servitude or some house of correction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko. He paused and asked quietly: &ldquo;You said the other
      day that people like Laevsky ought to be destroyed. . . . Tell me, if you
      . . . if the State or society commissioned you to destroy him, could you .
      . . bring yourself to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hand would not tremble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      When they got home, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went into their dark,
      stuffy, dull rooms. Both were silent. Laevsky lighted a candle, while
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down, and without taking off her cloak and hat,
      lifted her melancholy, guilty eyes to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she expected an explanation from him, but an explanation
      would be wearisome, useless and exhausting, and his heart was heavy
      because he had lost control over himself and been rude to her. He chanced
      to feel in his pocket the letter which he had been intending every day to
      read to her, and thought if he were to show her that letter now, it would
      turn her thoughts in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to define our relations,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I will give it her;
      what is to be will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out the letter and gave it her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it. It concerns you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he went into his own room and lay down on the sofa in the
      dark without a pillow. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read the letter, and it seemed
      to her as though the ceiling were falling and the walls were closing in on
      her. It seemed suddenly dark and shut in and terrible. She crossed herself
      quickly three times and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him peace, O Lord . . . give him peace. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she began crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanya,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Ivan Andreitch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Thinking that Laevsky had come in and was standing
      behind her chair, she sobbed like a child, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not tell me before that he was dead? I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to
      the picnic; I shouldn&rsquo;t have laughed so horribly. . . . The men said
      horrid things to me. What a sin, what a sin! Save me, Vanya, save me. . .
      . I have been mad. . . . I am lost. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky heard her sobs. He felt stifled and his heart was beating
      violently. In his misery he got up, stood in the middle of the room,
      groped his way in the dark to an easy-chair by the table, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a prison . . .&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must get away . . . I can&rsquo;t bear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to go and play cards; there were no restaurants in the
      town. He lay down again and covered his ears that he might not hear her
      sobbing, and he suddenly remembered that he could go to Samoylenko. To
      avoid going near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he got out of the window into the
      garden, climbed over the garden fence and went along the street. It was
      dark. A steamer, judging by its lights, a big passenger one, had just come
      in. He heard the clank of the anchor chain. A red light was moving rapidly
      from the shore in the direction of the steamer: it was the Customs boat
      going out to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The passengers are asleep in their cabins . . .&rdquo; thought Laevsky, and he
      envied the peace of mind of other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows in Samoylenko&rsquo;s house were open. Laevsky looked in at one of
      them, then in at another; it was dark and still in the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandr Daviditch, are you asleep?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Alexandr Daviditch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard a cough and an uneasy shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? What the devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Alexandr Daviditch; excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later the door opened; there was a glow of soft light from the
      lamp, and Samoylenko&rsquo;s huge figure appeared all in white, with a white
      nightcap on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he asked, scratching himself and breathing hard from
      sleepiness. &ldquo;Wait a minute; I&rsquo;ll open the door directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble; I&rsquo;ll get in at the window. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky climbed in at the window, and when he reached Samoylenko, seized
      him by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; he said in a shaking voice, &ldquo;save me! I beseech you,
      I implore you. Understand me! My position is agonising. If it goes on for
      another two days I shall strangle myself like . . . like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit. . . . What are you talking about exactly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light a candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh . . . oh! . . .&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko, lighting a candle. &ldquo;My God! My
      God! . . . Why, it&rsquo;s past one, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but I can&rsquo;t stay at home,&rdquo; said Laevsky, feeling great comfort
      from the light and the presence of Samoylenko. &ldquo;You are my best, my only
      friend, Alexandr Daviditch. . . . You are my only hope. For God&rsquo;s sake,
      come to my rescue, whether you want to or not. I must get away from here,
      come what may! . . . Lend me the money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, my God! . . .&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko, scratching himself. &ldquo;I was
      dropping asleep and I hear the whistle of the steamer, and now you . . .
      Do you want much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred roubles at least. I must leave her a hundred, and I need
      two hundred for the journey. . . . I owe you about four hundred already,
      but I will send it you all . . . all. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko took hold of both his whiskers in one hand, and standing with
      his legs wide apart, pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes . . .&rdquo; he muttered, musing. &ldquo;Three hundred. . . . Yes. . . . But I
      haven&rsquo;t got so much. I shall have to borrow it from some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borrow it, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; said Laevsky, seeing from Samoylenko&rsquo;s face
      that he wanted to lend him the money and certainly would lend it. &ldquo;Borrow
      it, and I&rsquo;ll be sure to pay you back. I will send it from Petersburg as
      soon as I get there. You can set your mind at rest about that. I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what, Sasha,&rdquo; he said, growing more animated; &ldquo;let us have some wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes . . . we can have some wine, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both went into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about Nadyezhda Fyodorovna?&rdquo; asked Samoylenko, setting three
      bottles and a plate of peaches on the table. &ldquo;Surely she&rsquo;s not remaining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will arrange it all, I will arrange it all,&rdquo; said Laevsky, feeling an
      unexpected rush of joy. &ldquo;I will send her the money afterwards and she will
      join me. . . . Then we will define our relations. To your health, friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;Drink this first. . . . This is from my
      vineyard. This bottle is from Navaridze&rsquo;s vineyard and this one is from
      Ahatulov&rsquo;s. . . . Try all three kinds and tell me candidly. . . . There
      seems a little acidity about mine. Eh? Don&rsquo;t you taste it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You have comforted me, Alexandr Daviditch. Thank you. . . . I feel
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any acidity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness only knows, I don&rsquo;t know. But you are a splendid, wonderful
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his pale, excited, good-natured face, Samoylenko remembered Von
      Koren&rsquo;s view that men like that ought to be destroyed, and Laevsky seemed
      to him a weak, defenceless child, whom any one could injure and destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you go, make it up with your mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I certainly shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a while. When they had emptied the first bottle,
      Samoylenko said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to make it up with Von Koren too. You are both such splendid,
      clever fellows, and you glare at each other like wolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a fine, very intelligent fellow,&rdquo; Laevsky assented, ready now
      to praise and forgive every one. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a remarkable man, but it&rsquo;s
      impossible for me to get on with him. No! Our natures are too different.
      I&rsquo;m an indolent, weak, submissive nature. Perhaps in a good minute I might
      hold out my hand to him, but he would turn away from me . . . with
      contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky took a sip of wine, walked from corner to corner and went on,
      standing in the middle of the room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand Von Koren very well. His is a resolute, strong, despotic
      nature. You have heard him continually talking of &lsquo;the expedition,&rsquo; and
      it&rsquo;s not mere talk. He wants the wilderness, the moonlit night: all around
      in little tents, under the open sky, lie sleeping his sick and hungry
      Cossacks, guides, porters, doctor, priest, all exhausted with their weary
      marches, while only he is awake, sitting like Stanley on a camp-stool,
      feeling himself the monarch of the desert and the master of these men. He
      goes on and on and on, his men groan and die, one after another, and he
      goes on and on, and in the end perishes himself, but still is monarch and
      ruler of the desert, since the cross upon his tomb can be seen by the
      caravans for thirty or forty miles over the desert. I am sorry the man is
      not in the army. He would have made a splendid military genius. He would
      not have hesitated to drown his cavalry in the river and make a bridge out
      of dead bodies. And such hardihood is more needed in war than any kind of
      fortification or strategy. Oh, I understand him perfectly! Tell me: why is
      he wasting his substance here? What does he want here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is studying the marine fauna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, brother, no!&rdquo; Laevsky sighed. &ldquo;A scientific man who was on the
      steamer told me the Black Sea was poor in animal life, and that in its
      depths, thanks to the abundance of sulphuric hydrogen, organic life was
      impossible. All the serious zoologists work at the biological station at
      Naples or Villefranche. But Von Koren is independent and obstinate: he
      works on the Black Sea because nobody else is working there; he is at
      loggerheads with the university, does not care to know his comrades and
      other scientific men because he is first of all a despot and only secondly
      a zoologist. And you&rsquo;ll see he&rsquo;ll do something. He is already dreaming
      that when he comes back from his expedition he will purify our
      universities from intrigue and mediocrity, and will make the scientific
      men mind their p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s. Despotism is just as strong in science as in
      the army. And he is spending his second summer in this stinking little
      town because he would rather be first in a village than second in a town.
      Here he is a king and an eagle; he keeps all the inhabitants under his
      thumb and oppresses them with his authority. He has appropriated every
      one, he meddles in other people&rsquo;s affairs; everything is of use to him,
      and every one is afraid of him. I am slipping out of his clutches, he
      feels that and hates me. Hasn&rsquo;t he told you that I ought to be destroyed
      or sent to hard labour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky laughed too, and drank some wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ideals are despotic too,&rdquo; he said, laughing, and biting a peach.
      &ldquo;Ordinary mortals think of their neighbour&mdash;me, you, man in fact&mdash;if
      they work for the common weal. To Von Koren men are puppets and
      nonentities, too trivial to be the object of his life. He works, will go
      for his expedition and break his neck there, not for the sake of love for
      his neighbour, but for the sake of such abstractions as humanity, future
      generations, an ideal race of men. He exerts himself for the improvement
      of the human race, and we are in his eyes only slaves, food for the
      cannon, beasts of burden; some he would destroy or stow away in Siberia,
      others he would break by discipline, would, like Araktcheev, force them to
      get up and go to bed to the sound of the drum; would appoint eunuchs to
      preserve our chastity and morality, would order them to fire at any one
      who steps out of the circle of our narrow conservative morality; and all
      this in the name of the improvement of the human race. . . . And what is
      the human race? Illusion, mirage . . . despots have always been
      illusionists. I understand him very well, brother. I appreciate him and
      don&rsquo;t deny his importance; this world rests on men like him, and if the
      world were left only to such men as us, for all our good-nature and good
      intentions, we should make as great a mess of it as the flies have of that
      picture. Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky sat down beside Samoylenko, and said with genuine feeling: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
      foolish, worthless, depraved man. The air I breathe, this wine, love, life
      in fact&mdash;for all that, I have given nothing in exchange so far but
      lying, idleness, and cowardice. Till now I have deceived myself and other
      people; I have been miserable about it, and my misery was cheap and
      common. I bow my back humbly before Von Koren&rsquo;s hatred because at times I
      hate and despise myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky began again pacing from one end of the room to the other in
      excitement, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I see my faults clearly and am conscious of them. That will help
      me to reform and become a different man. My dear fellow, if only you knew
      how passionately, with what anguish, I long for such a change. And I swear
      to you I&rsquo;ll be a man! I will! I don&rsquo;t know whether it is the wine that is
      speaking in me, or whether it really is so, but it seems to me that it is
      long since I have spent such pure and lucid moments as I have just now
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to sleep, brother,&rdquo; said Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. . . . Excuse me; I&rsquo;ll go directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky moved hurriedly about the furniture and windows, looking for his
      cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he muttered, sighing. &ldquo;Thank you. . . . Kind and friendly
      words are better than charity. You have given me new life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found his cap, stopped, and looked guiltily at Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; he said in an imploring voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me stay the night with you, my dear fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. . . . Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky lay down on the sofa, and went on talking to the doctor for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three days after the picnic, Marya Konstantinovna unexpectedly called on
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and without greeting her or taking off her hat,
      seized her by both hands, pressed them to her breast and said in great
      excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I am deeply touched and moved: our dear kind-hearted doctor told
      my Nikodim Alexandritch yesterday that your husband was dead. Tell me, my
      dear . . . tell me, is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true; he is dead,&rdquo; answered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is awful, awful, my dear! But there&rsquo;s no evil without some
      compensation; your husband was no doubt a noble, wonderful, holy man, and
      such are more needed in Heaven than on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every line and feature in Marya Konstantinovna&rsquo;s face began quivering as
      though little needles were jumping up and down under her skin; she gave an
      almond-oily smile and said, breathlessly, enthusiastically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are free, my dear. You can hold your head high now, and look
      people boldly in the face. Henceforth God and man will bless your union
      with Ivan Andreitch. It&rsquo;s enchanting. I am trembling with joy, I can find
      no words. My dear, I will give you away. . . . Nikodim Alexandritch and I
      have been so fond of you, you will allow us to give our blessing to your
      pure, lawful union. When, when do you think of being married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought of it,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, freeing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, my dear. You have thought of it, you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, laughing. &ldquo;What
      should we be married for? I see no necessity for it. We&rsquo;ll go on living as
      we have lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying!&rdquo; cried Marya Konstantinovna in horror. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
      sake, what are you saying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our getting married won&rsquo;t make things any better. On the contrary, it
      will make them even worse. We shall lose our freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my dear, what are you saying!&rdquo; exclaimed Marya Konstantinovna,
      stepping back and flinging up her hands. &ldquo;You are talking wildly! Think
      what you are saying. You must settle down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Settle down.&rsquo; How do you mean? I have not lived yet, and you tell me to
      settle down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna reflected that she really had not lived. She had
      finished her studies in a boarding-school and had been married to a man
      she did not love; then she had thrown in her lot with Laevsky, and had
      spent all her time with him on this empty, desolate coast, always
      expecting something better. Was that life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be married though,&rdquo; she thought, but remembering Kirilin and
      Atchmianov she flushed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s impossible. Even if Ivan Andreitch begged me to on his knees&mdash;even
      then I would refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Konstantinovna sat on the sofa for a minute in silence, grave and
      mournful, gazing fixedly into space; then she got up and said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my dear! Forgive me for having troubled you. Though it&rsquo;s not
      easy for me, it&rsquo;s my duty to tell you that from this day all is over
      between us, and, in spite of my profound respect for Ivan Andreitch, the
      door of my house is closed to you henceforth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered these words with great solemnity and was herself overwhelmed
      by her solemn tone. Her face began quivering again; it assumed a soft
      almond-oily expression. She held out both hands to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      who was overcome with alarm and confusion, and said in an imploring voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, allow me if only for a moment to be a mother or an elder sister
      to you! I will be as frank with you as a mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt in her bosom warmth, gladness, and pity for
      herself, as though her own mother had really risen up and were standing
      before her. She impulsively embraced Marya Konstantinovna and pressed her
      face to her shoulder. Both of them shed tears. They sat down on the sofa
      and for a few minutes sobbed without looking at one another or being able
      to utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; began Marya Konstantinovna, &ldquo;I will tell you some harsh
      truths, without sparing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, for God&rsquo;s sake, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, my dear. You remember of all the ladies here, I was the only
      one to receive you. You horrified me from the very first day, but I had
      not the heart to treat you with disdain like all the rest. I grieved over
      dear, good Ivan Andreitch as though he were my son &mdash;a young man in a
      strange place, inexperienced, weak, with no mother; and I was worried,
      dreadfully worried. . . . My husband was opposed to our making his
      acquaintance, but I talked him over . . . persuaded him. . . . We began
      receiving Ivan Andreitch, and with him, of course, you. If we had not, he
      would have been insulted. I have a daughter, a son. . . . You understand
      the tender mind, the pure heart of childhood . . . &lsquo;who so offendeth one
      of these little ones.&rsquo; . . . I received you into my house and trembled for
      my children. Oh, when you become a mother, you will understand my fears.
      And every one was surprised at my receiving you, excuse my saying so, as a
      respectable woman, and hinted to me . . . well, of course, slanders,
      suppositions. . . . At the bottom of my heart I blamed you, but you were
      unhappy, flighty, to be pitied, and my heart was wrung with pity for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, why?&rdquo; asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, trembling all over. &ldquo;What harm
      have I done any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a terrible sinner. You broke the vow you made your husband at the
      altar. You seduced a fine young man, who perhaps had he not met you might
      have taken a lawful partner for life from a good family in his own circle,
      and would have been like every one else now. You have ruined his youth.
      Don&rsquo;t speak, don&rsquo;t speak, my dear! I never believe that man is to blame
      for our sins. It is always the woman&rsquo;s fault. Men are frivolous in
      domestic life; they are guided by their minds, and not by their hearts.
      There&rsquo;s a great deal they don&rsquo;t understand; woman understands it all.
      Everything depends on her. To her much is given and from her much will be
      required. Oh, my dear, if she had been more foolish or weaker than man on
      that side, God would not have entrusted her with the education of boys and
      girls. And then, my dear, you entered on the path of vice, forgetting all
      modesty; any other woman in your place would have hidden herself from
      people, would have sat shut up at home, and would only have been seen in
      the temple of God, pale, dressed all in black and weeping, and every one
      would have said in genuine compassion: &lsquo;O Lord, this erring angel is
      coming back again to Thee . . . .&rsquo; But you, my dear, have forgotten all
      discretion; have lived openly, extravagantly; have seemed to be proud of
      your sin; you have been gay and laughing, and I, looking at you, shuddered
      with horror, and have been afraid that thunder from Heaven would strike
      our house while you were sitting with us. My dear, don&rsquo;t speak, don&rsquo;t
      speak,&rdquo; cried Marya Konstantinovna, observing that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      wanted to speak. &ldquo;Trust me, I will not deceive you, I will not hide one
      truth from the eyes of your soul. Listen to me, my dear. . . . God marks
      great sinners, and you have been marked-out: only think&mdash;your
      costumes have always been appalling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, who had always had the highest opinion of her
      costumes, left off crying and looked at her with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, appalling,&rdquo; Marya Konstantinovna went on. &ldquo;Any one could judge of
      your behaviour from the elaboration and gaudiness of your attire. People
      laughed and shrugged their shoulders as they looked at you, and I grieved,
      I grieved. . . . And forgive me, my dear; you are not nice in your person!
      When we met in the bathing-place, you made me tremble. Your outer clothing
      was decent enough, but your petticoat, your chemise. . . . My dear, I
      blushed! Poor Ivan Andreitch! No one ever ties his cravat properly, and
      from his linen and his boots, poor fellow! one can see he has no one at
      home to look after him. And he is always hungry, my darling, and of
      course, if there is no one at home to think of the samovar and the coffee,
      one is forced to spend half one&rsquo;s salary at the pavilion. And it&rsquo;s simply
      awful, awful in your home! No one else in the town has flies, but there&rsquo;s
      no getting rid of them in your rooms: all the plates and dishes are black
      with them. If you look at the windows and the chairs, there&rsquo;s nothing but
      dust, dead flies, and glasses. . . . What do you want glasses standing
      about for? And, my dear, the table&rsquo;s not cleared till this time in the
      day. And one&rsquo;s ashamed to go into your bedroom: underclothes flung about
      everywhere, india-rubber tubes hanging on the walls, pails and basins
      standing about. . . . My dear! A husband ought to know nothing, and his
      wife ought to be as neat as a little angel in his presence. I wake up
      every morning before it is light, and wash my face with cold water that my
      Nikodim Alexandritch may not see me looking drowsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sobbed. &ldquo;If only I were happy,
      but I am so unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; you are very unhappy!&rdquo; Marya Konstantinovna sighed, hardly able
      to restrain herself from weeping. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s terrible grief in store for
      you in the future! A solitary old age, ill-health; and then you will have
      to answer at the dread judgment seat. . . It&rsquo;s awful, awful. Now fate
      itself holds out to you a helping hand, and you madly thrust it from you.
      Be married, make haste and be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we must, we must,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible. Oh, if only you knew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna had an impulse to tell her about Kirilin, and how the
      evening before she had met handsome young Atchmianov at the harbour, and
      how the mad, ridiculous idea had occurred to her of cancelling her debt
      for three hundred; it had amused her very much, and she returned home late
      in the evening feeling that she had sold herself and was irrevocably lost.
      She did not know herself how it had happened. And she longed to swear to
      Marya Konstantinovna that she would certainly pay that debt, but sobs and
      shame prevented her from speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ivan Andreitch may stay, but I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how will you live there? Why, you have nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do translation, or . . . or I will open a library . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your fancy run away with you, my dear. You must have money for
      a library. Well, I will leave you now, and you calm yourself and think
      things over, and to-morrow come and see me, bright and happy. That will be
      enchanting! Well, good-bye, my angel. Let me kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Konstantinovna kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on the forehead, made the
      sign of the cross over her, and softly withdrew. It was getting dark, and
      Olga lighted up in the kitchen. Still crying, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went
      into the bedroom and lay down on the bed. She began to be very feverish.
      She undressed without getting up, crumpled up her clothes at her feet, and
      curled herself up under the bedclothes. She was thirsty, and there was no
      one to give her something to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay it back!&rdquo; she said to herself, and it seemed to her in delirium
      that she was sitting beside some sick woman, and recognised her as
      herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay it back. It would be stupid to imagine that it was for
      money I . . . I will go away and send him the money from Petersburg. At
      first a hundred . . . then another hundred . . . and then the third
      hundred. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late at night when Laevsky came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first a hundred . . .&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said to him, &ldquo;then another
      hundred . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to take some quinine,&rdquo; he said, and thought, &ldquo;To-morrow is
      Wednesday; the steamer goes and I am not going in it. So I shall have to
      go on living here till Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna knelt up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything just now, did I?&rdquo; she asked, smiling and screwing
      up her eyes at the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing. We shall have to send for the doctor to-morrow morning. Go
      to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his pillow and went to the door. Ever since he had finally made up
      his mind to go away and leave Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, she had begun to raise
      in him pity and a sense of guilt; he felt a little ashamed in her
      presence, as though in the presence of a sick or old horse whom one has
      decided to kill. He stopped in the doorway and looked round at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was out of humour at the picnic and said something rude to you. Forgive
      me, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he went off to his study, lay down, and for a long while
      could not get to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning when Samoylenko, attired, as it was a holiday, in full-dress
      uniform with epaulettes on his shoulders and decorations on his breast,
      came out of the bedroom after feeling Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s pulse and
      looking at her tongue, Laevsky, who was standing in the doorway, asked him
      anxiously: &ldquo;Well? Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an expression of terror, of extreme uneasiness, and of hope on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself; there&rsquo;s nothing dangerous,&rdquo; said Samoylenko; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      the usual fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo; Laevsky frowned impatiently. &ldquo;Have you got the
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear soul, forgive me,&rdquo; he whispered, looking round at the door and
      overcome with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, forgive me! No one has anything to spare, and I&rsquo;ve only
      been able to collect by five- and by ten-rouble notes. . . . Only a
      hundred and ten in all. To-day I&rsquo;ll speak to some one else. Have
      patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Saturday is the latest date,&rdquo; whispered Laevsky, trembling with
      impatience. &ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s sacred, get it by Saturday! If I don&rsquo;t get away
      by Saturday, nothing&rsquo;s any use, nothing! I can&rsquo;t understand how a doctor
      can be without money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord have mercy on us!&rdquo; Samoylenko whispered rapidly and intensely, and
      there was positively a breaking note in his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been stripped of
      everything; I am owed seven thousand, and I&rsquo;m in debt all round. Is it my
      fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll get it by Saturday? Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you, my dear fellow! So that the money may be in my hands by
      Friday morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko sat down and prescribed solution of quinine and kalii bromati
      and tincture of rhubarb, tincturæ gentianæ, aquæ foeniculi &mdash;all in
      one mixture, added some pink syrup to sweeten it, and went away.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as though you were coming to arrest me,&rdquo; said Von Koren, seeing
      Samoylenko coming in, in his full-dress uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was passing by and thought: &lsquo;Suppose I go in and pay my respects to
      zoology,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Samoylenko, sitting down at the big table, knocked
      together by the zoologist himself out of plain boards. &ldquo;Good-morning, holy
      father,&rdquo; he said to the deacon, who was sitting in the window, copying
      something. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay a minute and then run home to see about dinner. It&rsquo;s
      time. . . . I&rsquo;m not hindering you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; answered the zoologist, laying out over the table
      slips of paper covered with small writing. &ldquo;We are busy copying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! . . . Oh, my goodness, my goodness! . . .&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko. He
      cautiously took up from the table a dusty book on which there was lying a
      dead dried spider, and said: &ldquo;Only fancy, though; some little green beetle
      is going about its business, when suddenly a monster like this swoops down
      upon it. I can fancy its terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is poison given it to protect it from its enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to protect it and enable it to attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, to be sure. . . . And everything in nature, my dear fellows,
      is consistent and can be explained,&rdquo; sighed Samoylenko; &ldquo;only I tell you
      what I don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;re a man of very great intellect, so explain
      it to me, please. There are, you know, little beasts no bigger than rats,
      rather handsome to look at, but nasty and immoral in the extreme, let me
      tell you. Suppose such a little beast is running in the woods. He sees a
      bird; he catches it and devours it. He goes on and sees in the grass a
      nest of eggs; he does not want to eat them&mdash;he is not hungry, but yet
      he tastes one egg and scatters the others out of the nest with his paw.
      Then he meets a frog and begins to play with it; when he has tormented the
      frog he goes on licking himself and meets a beetle; he crushes the beetle
      with his paw . . . and so he spoils and destroys everything on his way. .
      . . He creeps into other beasts&rsquo; holes, tears up the anthills, cracks the
      snail&rsquo;s shell. If he meets a rat, he fights with it; if he meets a snake
      or a mouse, he must strangle it; and so the whole day long. Come, tell me:
      what is the use of a beast like that? Why was he created?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what animal you are talking of,&rdquo; said Von Koren; &ldquo;most
      likely one of the insectivora. Well, he got hold of the bird because it
      was incautious; he broke the nest of eggs because the bird was not
      skilful, had made the nest badly and did not know how to conceal it. The
      frog probably had some defect in its colouring or he would not have seen
      it, and so on. Your little beast only destroys the weak, the unskilful,
      the careless&mdash;in fact, those who have defects which nature does not
      think fit to hand on to posterity. Only the cleverer, the stronger, the
      more careful and developed survive; and so your little beast, without
      suspecting it, is serving the great ends of perfecting creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes. . . . By the way, brother,&rdquo; said Samoylenko carelessly,
      &ldquo;lend me a hundred roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. There are some very interesting types among the insectivorous
      mammals. For instance, the mole is said to be useful because he devours
      noxious insects. There is a story that some German sent William I. a fur
      coat made of moleskins, and the Emperor ordered him to be reproved for
      having destroyed so great a number of useful animals. And yet the mole is
      not a bit less cruel than your little beast, and is very mischievous
      besides, as he spoils meadows terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren opened a box and took out a hundred-rouble note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mole has a powerful thorax, just like the bat,&rdquo; he went on, shutting
      the box; &ldquo;the bones and muscles are tremendously developed, the mouth is
      extraordinarily powerfully furnished. If it had the proportions of an
      elephant, it would be an all-destructive, invincible animal. It is
      interesting when two moles meet underground; they begin at once as though
      by agreement digging a little platform; they need the platform in order to
      have a battle more conveniently. When they have made it they enter upon a
      ferocious struggle and fight till the weaker one falls. Take the hundred
      roubles,&rdquo; said Von Koren, dropping his voice, &ldquo;but only on condition that
      you&rsquo;re not borrowing it for Laevsky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it were for Laevsky,&rdquo; cried Samoylenko, flaring up, &ldquo;what is that
      to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give it to you for Laevsky. I know you like lending people money.
      You would give it to Kerim, the brigand, if he were to ask you; but,
      excuse me, I can&rsquo;t assist you in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is for Laevsky I am asking it,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, standing up and
      waving his right arm. &ldquo;Yes! For Laevsky! And no one, fiend or devil, has a
      right to dictate to me how to dispose of my own money. It doesn&rsquo;t suit you
      to lend it me? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon began laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, but be reasonable,&rdquo; said the zoologist. &ldquo;To shower
      benefits on Mr. Laevsky is, to my thinking, as senseless as to water weeds
      or to feed locusts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my thinking, it is our duty to help our neighbours!&rdquo; cried Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, help that hungry Turk who is lying under the fence! He is a
      workman and more useful and indispensable than your Laevsky. Give him that
      hundred-rouble note! Or subscribe a hundred roubles to my expedition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me the money or not? I ask you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me openly: what does he want money for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a secret; he wants to go to Petersburg on Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is it!&rdquo; Von Koren drawled out. &ldquo;Aha! . . . We understand. And is
      she going with him, or how is it to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s staying here for the time. He&rsquo;ll arrange his affairs in Petersburg
      and send her the money, and then she&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s smart!&rdquo; said the zoologist, and he gave a short tenor laugh.
      &ldquo;Smart, well planned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went rapidly up to Samoylenko, and standing face to face with him, and
      looking him in the eyes, asked: &ldquo;Tell me now honestly: is he tired of her?
      Yes? tell me: is he tired of her? Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Samoylenko articulated, beginning to perspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How repulsive it is!&rdquo; said Von Koren, and from his face it could be seen
      that he felt repulsion. &ldquo;One of two things, Alexandr Daviditch: either you
      are in the plot with him, or, excuse my saying so, you are a simpleton.
      Surely you must see that he is taking you in like a child in the most
      shameless way? Why, it&rsquo;s as clear as day that he wants to get rid of her
      and abandon her here. She&rsquo;ll be left a burden on you. It is as clear as
      day that you will have to send her to Petersburg at your expense. Surely
      your fine friend can&rsquo;t have so blinded you by his dazzling qualities that
      you can&rsquo;t see the simplest thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all supposition,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposition? But why is he going alone instead of taking her with him?
      And ask him why he doesn&rsquo;t send her off first. The sly beast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overcome with sudden doubts and suspicions about his friend, Samoylenko
      weakened and took a humbler tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; he said, recalling the night Laevsky had spent at
      his house. &ldquo;He is so unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? Thieves and incendiaries are unhappy too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even supposing you are right . . .&rdquo; said Samoylenko, hesitating. &ldquo;Let us
      admit it. . . . Still, he&rsquo;s a young man in a strange place . . . a
      student. We have been students, too, and there is no one but us to come to
      his assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help him to do abominable things, because he and you at different
      times have been at universities, and neither of you did anything there!
      What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop; let us talk it over coolly. I imagine it will be possible to make
      some arrangement. . . .&rdquo; Samoylenko reflected, twiddling his fingers.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him the money, you see, but make him promise on his honour that
      within a week he&rsquo;ll send Nadyezhda Fyodorovna the money for the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll give you his word of honour&mdash;in fact, he&rsquo;ll shed tears and
      believe in it himself; but what&rsquo;s his word of honour worth? He won&rsquo;t keep
      it, and when in a year or two you meet him on the Nevsky Prospect with a
      new mistress on his arm, he&rsquo;ll excuse himself on the ground that he has
      been crippled by civilisation, and that he is made after the pattern of
      Rudin. Drop him, for God&rsquo;s sake! Keep away from the filth; don&rsquo;t stir it
      up with both hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko thought for a minute and said resolutely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall give him the money all the same. As you please. I can&rsquo;t bring
      myself to refuse a man simply on an assumption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine, too. You can kiss him if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the hundred roubles, then,&rdquo; Samoylenko asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Samoylenko was quite crushed; his face wore a guilty,
      abashed, and ingratiating expression, and it was strange to see this
      pitiful, childish, shamefaced countenance on a huge man wearing epaulettes
      and orders of merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bishop here goes the round of his diocese on horseback instead of in
      a carriage,&rdquo; said the deacon, laying down his pen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely
      touching to see him sit on his horse. His simplicity and humility are full
      of Biblical grandeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good man?&rdquo; asked Von Koren, who was glad to change the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! If he hadn&rsquo;t been a good man, do you suppose he would have
      been consecrated a bishop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the bishops are to be found good and gifted men,&rdquo; said Von Koren.
      &ldquo;The only drawback is that some of them have the weakness to imagine
      themselves statesmen. One busies himself with Russification, another
      criticises the sciences. That&rsquo;s not their business. They had much better
      look into their consistory a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A layman cannot judge of bishops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, deacon? A bishop is a man just the same as you or I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, but not the same.&rdquo; The deacon was offended and took up his pen.
      &ldquo;If you had been the same, the Divine Grace would have rested upon you,
      and you would have been bishop yourself; and since you are not bishop, it
      follows you are not the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, deacon,&rdquo; said Samoylenko dejectedly. &ldquo;Listen to what
      I suggest,&rdquo; he said, turning to Von Koren. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that hundred
      roubles. You&rsquo;ll be having your dinners with me for three months before the
      winter, so let me have the money beforehand for three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko blinked and turned crimson; he mechanically drew towards him
      the book with the spider on it and looked at it, then he got up and took
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren felt sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it is to have to live and do with people like this,&rdquo; said the
      zoologist, and he kicked a paper into the corner with indignation. &ldquo;You
      must understand that this is not kindness, it is not love, but cowardice,
      slackness, poison! What&rsquo;s gained by reason is lost by your flabby
      good-for-nothing hearts! When I was ill with typhoid as a schoolboy, my
      aunt in her sympathy gave me pickled mushrooms to eat, and I very nearly
      died. You, and my aunt too, must understand that love for man is not to be
      found in the heart or the stomach or the bowels, but here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren slapped himself on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; he said, and thrust a hundred-rouble note into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no need to be angry, Kolya,&rdquo; said Samoylenko mildly, folding up
      the note. &ldquo;I quite understand you, but . . . you must put yourself in my
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an old woman, that&rsquo;s what you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear my last request, Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; said Von Koren hotly. &ldquo;When
      you give that scoundrel the money, make it a condition that he takes his
      lady with him, or sends her on ahead, and don&rsquo;t give it him without.
      There&rsquo;s no need to stand on ceremony with him. Tell him so, or, if you
      don&rsquo;t, I give you my word I&rsquo;ll go to his office and kick him downstairs,
      and I&rsquo;ll break off all acquaintance with you. So you&rsquo;d better know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! To go with her or send her on beforehand will be more convenient
      for him,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be delighted indeed. Well, goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said good-bye affectionately and went out, but before shutting the door
      after him, he looked round at Von Koren and, with a ferocious face, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Germans who have ruined you, brother! Yes! The Germans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      XII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Next day, Thursday, Marya Konstantinovna was celebrating the birthday of
      her Kostya. All were invited to come at midday and eat pies, and in the
      evening to drink chocolate. When Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna arrived
      in the evening, the zoologist, who was already sitting in the
      drawing-room, drinking chocolate, asked Samoylenko:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you talked to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind now, don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony. I can&rsquo;t understand the insolence of
      these people! Why, they know perfectly well the view taken by this family
      of their cohabitation, and yet they force themselves in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one is to pay attention to every prejudice,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, &ldquo;one
      could go nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that the repugnance felt by the masses for illicit
      love and moral laxity is a prejudice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. It&rsquo;s prejudice and hate. When the soldiers see a girl of
      light behaviour, they laugh and whistle; but just ask them what they are
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for nothing they whistle. The fact that girls strangle their
      illegitimate children and go to prison for it, and that Anna Karenin flung
      herself under the train, and that in the villages they smear the gates
      with tar, and that you and I, without knowing why, are pleased by Katya&rsquo;s
      purity, and that every one of us feels a vague craving for pure love,
      though he knows there is no such love&mdash;is all that prejudice? That is
      the one thing, brother, which has survived intact from natural selection,
      and, if it were not for that obscure force regulating the relations of the
      sexes, the Laevskys would have it all their own way, and mankind would
      degenerate in two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky came into the drawing-room, greeted every one, and shaking hands
      with Von Koren, smiled ingratiatingly. He waited for a favourable moment
      and said to Samoylenko:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Alexandr Daviditch, I must say two words to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko got up, put his arm round Laevsky&rsquo;s waist, and both of them
      went into Nikodim Alexandritch&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Friday,&rdquo; said Laevsky, biting his nails. &ldquo;Have you got what
      you promised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only got two hundred. I&rsquo;ll get the rest to-day or to-morrow. Don&rsquo;t
      worry yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God . . .&rdquo; sighed Laevsky, and his hands began trembling with joy.
      &ldquo;You are saving me, Alexandr Daviditch, and I swear to you by God, by my
      happiness and anything you like, I&rsquo;ll send you the money as soon as I
      arrive. And I&rsquo;ll send you my old debt too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Vanya . . .&rdquo; said Samoylenko, turning crimson and taking him
      by the button. &ldquo;You must forgive my meddling in your private affairs, but
      . . . why shouldn&rsquo;t you take Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You queer fellow. How is that possible? One of us must stay, or our
      creditors will raise an outcry. You see, I owe seven hundred or more to
      the shops. Only wait, and I will send them the money. I&rsquo;ll stop their
      mouths, and then she can come away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. . . . But why shouldn&rsquo;t you send her on first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness, as though that were possible!&rdquo; Laevsky was horrified. &ldquo;Why,
      she&rsquo;s a woman; what would she do there alone? What does she know about it?
      That would only be a loss of time and a useless waste of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s reasonable . . .&rdquo; thought Samoylenko, but remembering his
      conversation with Von Koren, he looked down and said sullenly: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      agree with you. Either go with her or send her first; otherwise . . .
      otherwise I won&rsquo;t give you the money. Those are my last words. . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staggered back, lurched backwards against the door, and went into the
      drawing-room, crimson, and overcome with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday . . . Friday,&rdquo; thought Laevsky, going back into the drawing-room.
      &ldquo;Friday. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was handed a cup of chocolate; he burnt his lips and tongue with the
      scalding chocolate and thought: &ldquo;Friday . . . Friday. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason he could not get the word &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; out of his head; he
      could think of nothing but Friday, and the only thing that was clear to
      him, not in his brain but somewhere in his heart, was that he would not
      get off on Saturday. Before him stood Nikodim Alexandritch, very neat,
      with his hair combed over his temples, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take something to eat. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marya Konstantinovna showed the visitors Katya&rsquo;s school report and said,
      drawling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, very difficult to do well at school nowadays! So much is
      expected . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; groaned Katya, not knowing where to hide her confusion at the
      praises of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky, too, looked at the report and praised it. Scripture, Russian
      language, conduct, fives and fours, danced before his eyes, and all this,
      mixed with the haunting refrain of &ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; with the carefully combed
      locks of Nikodim Alexandritch and the red cheeks of Katya, produced on him
      a sensation of such immense overwhelming boredom that he almost shrieked
      with despair and asked himself: &ldquo;Is it possible, is it possible I shall
      not get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They put two card tables side by side and sat down to play post. Laevsky
      sat down too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday . . . Friday . . .&rdquo; he kept thinking, as he smiled and took a
      pencil out of his pocket. &ldquo;Friday. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to think over his position, and was afraid to think. It was
      terrible to him to realise that the doctor had detected him in the
      deception which he had so long and carefully concealed from himself. Every
      time he thought of his future he would not let his thoughts have full
      rein. He would get into the train and set off, and thereby the problem of
      his life would be solved, and he did not let his thoughts go farther. Like
      a far-away dim light in the fields, the thought sometimes flickered in his
      mind that in one of the side-streets of Petersburg, in the remote future,
      he would have to have recourse to a tiny lie in order to get rid of
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and pay his debts; he would tell a lie only once, and
      then a completely new life would begin. And that was right: at the price
      of a small lie he would win so much truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when by his blunt refusal the doctor had crudely hinted at his
      deception, he began to understand that he would need deception not only in
      the remote future, but to-day, and to-morrow, and in a month&rsquo;s time, and
      perhaps up to the very end of his life. In fact, in order to get away he
      would have to lie to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, to his creditors, and to his
      superiors in the Service; then, in order to get money in Petersburg, he
      would have to lie to his mother, to tell her that he had already broken
      with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; and his mother would not give him more than
      five hundred roubles, so he had already deceived the doctor, as he would
      not be in a position to pay him back the money within a short time.
      Afterwards, when Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came to Petersburg, he would have to
      resort to a regular series of deceptions, little and big, in order to get
      free of her; and again there would be tears, boredom, a disgusting
      existence, remorse, and so there would be no new life. Deception and
      nothing more. A whole mountain of lies rose before Laevsky&rsquo;s imagination.
      To leap over it at one bound and not to do his lying piecemeal, he would
      have to bring himself to stern, uncompromising action; for instance, to
      getting up without saying a word, putting on his hat, and at once setting
      off without money and without explanation. But Laevsky felt that was
      impossible for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday, Friday . . .&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Friday. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They wrote little notes, folded them in two, and put them in Nikodim
      Alexandritch&rsquo;s old top-hat. When there were a sufficient heap of notes,
      Kostya, who acted the part of postman, walked round the table and
      delivered them. The deacon, Katya, and Kostya, who received amusing notes
      and tried to write as funnily as they could, were highly delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have a little talk,&rdquo; Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read in a little note;
      she glanced at Marya Konstantinovna, who gave her an almond-oily smile and
      nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of what?&rdquo; thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. &ldquo;If one can&rsquo;t tell the
      whole, it&rsquo;s no use talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before going out for the evening she had tied Laevsky&rsquo;s cravat for him,
      and that simple action filled her soul with tenderness and sorrow. The
      anxiety in his face, his absent-minded looks, his pallor, and the
      incomprehensible change that had taken place in him of late, and the fact
      that she had a terrible revolting secret from him, and the fact that her
      hands trembled when she tied his cravat&mdash;all this seemed to tell her
      that they had not long left to be together. She looked at him as though he
      were an ikon, with terror and penitence, and thought: &ldquo;Forgive, forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opposite her was sitting Atchmianov, and he never took his black,
      love-sick eyes off her. She was stirred by passion; she was ashamed of
      herself, and afraid that even her misery and sorrow would not prevent her
      from yielding to impure desire to-morrow, if not to-day &mdash;and that,
      like a drunkard, she would not have the strength to stop herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made up her mind to go away that she might not continue this life,
      shameful for herself, and humiliating for Laevsky. She would beseech him
      with tears to let her go; and if he opposed her, she would go away
      secretly. She would not tell him what had happened; let him keep a pure
      memory of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, I love you, I love you,&rdquo; she read. It was from Atchmianov.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would live in some far remote place, would work and send Laevsky,
      &ldquo;anonymously,&rdquo; money, embroidered shirts, and tobacco, and would return to
      him only in old age or if he were dangerously ill and needed a nurse. When
      in his old age he learned what were her reasons for leaving him and
      refusing to be his wife, he would appreciate her sacrifice and forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a long nose.&rdquo; That must be from the deacon or Kostya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna imagined how, parting from Laevsky, she would embrace
      him warmly, would kiss his hand, and would swear to love him all her life,
      all her life, and then, living in obscurity among strangers, she would
      every day think that somewhere she had a friend, some one she loved&mdash;a
      pure, noble, lofty man who kept a pure memory of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me an interview to-day, I shall take measures, I assure
      you on my word of honour. You can&rsquo;t treat decent people like this; you
      must understand that.&rdquo; That was from Kirilin.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Laevsky received two notes; he opened one and read: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, my
      darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have written that?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Not Samoylenko, of course. And
      not the deacon, for he doesn&rsquo;t know I want to go away. Von Koren,
      perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The zoologist bent over the table and drew a pyramid. Laevsky fancied that
      his eyes were smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most likely Samoylenko . . . has been gossiping,&rdquo; thought Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other note, in the same disguised angular handwriting with long
      tails to the letters, was written: &ldquo;Somebody won&rsquo;t go away on Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stupid gibe,&rdquo; thought Laevsky. &ldquo;Friday, Friday. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something rose in his throat. He touched his collar and coughed, but
      instead of a cough a laugh broke from his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha! What am I laughing at? Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to restrain himself, covered his mouth with his hand, but the
      laugh choked his chest and throat, and his hand could not cover his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid it is!&rdquo; he thought, rolling with laughter. &ldquo;Have I gone out of
      my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laugh grew shriller and shriller, and became something like the bark
      of a lap-dog. Laevsky tried to get up from the table, but his legs would
      not obey him and his right hand was strangely, without his volition,
      dancing on the table, convulsively clutching and crumpling up the bits of
      paper. He saw looks of wonder, Samoylenko&rsquo;s grave, frightened face, and
      the eyes of the zoologist full of cold irony and disgust, and realised
      that he was in hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hideous, how shameful!&rdquo; he thought, feeling the warmth of tears on
      his face. &ldquo;. . . Oh, oh, what a disgrace! It has never happened to me. . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took him under his arms, and supporting his head from behind, led him
      away; a glass gleamed before his eyes and knocked against his teeth, and
      the water was spilt on his breast; he was in a little room, with two beds
      in the middle, side by side, covered by two snow-white quilts. He dropped
      on one of the beds and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Samoylenko kept saying; &ldquo;it does happen . .
      . it does happen. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chill with horror, trembling all over and dreading something awful,
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna stood by the bedside and kept asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What is it? For God&rsquo;s sake, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can Kirilin have written him something?&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Laevsky, laughing and crying; &ldquo;go away, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face expressed neither hatred nor repulsion: so he knew nothing;
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was somewhat reassured, and she went into the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t agitate yourself, my dear!&rdquo; said Marya Konstantinovna, sitting down
      beside her and taking her hand. &ldquo;It will pass. Men are just as weak as we
      poor sinners. You are both going through a crisis. . . . One can so well
      understand it! Well, my dear, I am waiting for an answer. Let us have a
      little talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we are not going to talk,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, listening to
      Laevsky&rsquo;s sobs. &ldquo;I feel depressed. . . . You must allow me to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, what do you mean, my dear?&rdquo; cried Marya Konstantinovna
      in alarm. &ldquo;Do you think I could let you go without supper? We will have
      something to eat, and then you may go with my blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel miserable . . .&rdquo; whispered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she caught at
      the arm of the chair with both hands to avoid falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a touch of hysterics,&rdquo; said Von Koren gaily, coming into the
      drawing-room, but seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he was taken aback and
      retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the attack was over, Laevsky sat on the strange bed and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgraceful! I&rsquo;ve been howling like some wretched girl! I must have been
      absurd and disgusting. I will go away by the back stairs . . . . But that
      would seem as though I took my hysterics too seriously. I ought to take it
      as a joke. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked in the looking-glass, sat there for some time, and went back
      into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he said, smiling; he felt agonisingly ashamed, and he felt
      others were ashamed in his presence. &ldquo;Fancy such a thing happening,&rdquo; he
      said, sitting down. &ldquo;I was sitting here, and all of a sudden, do you know,
      I felt a terrible piercing pain in my side . . . unendurable, my nerves
      could not stand it, and . . . and it led to this silly performance. This
      is the age of nerves; there is no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At supper he drank some wine, and, from time to time, with an abrupt sigh
      rubbed his side as though to suggest that he still felt the pain. And no
      one, except Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, believed him, and he saw that.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nine o&rsquo;clock they went for a walk on the boulevard. Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, afraid that Kirilin would speak to her, did her best to keep
      all the time beside Marya Konstantinovna and the children. She felt weak
      with fear and misery, and felt she was going to be feverish; she was
      exhausted and her legs would hardly move, but she did not go home, because
      she felt sure that she would be followed by Kirilin or Atchmianov or both
      at once. Kirilin walked behind her with Nikodim Alexandritch, and kept
      humming in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t al-low people to play with me! I don&rsquo;t al-low it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the boulevard they went back to the pavilion and walked along the
      beach, and looked for a long time at the phosphorescence on the water. Von
      Koren began telling them why it looked phosphorescent.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I went to my <i>vint</i>. . . . They will be waiting for me,&rdquo;
       said Laevsky. &ldquo;Good-bye, my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you; wait a minute,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she
      took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said good-bye to the company and went away. Kirilin took leave too,
      and saying that he was going the same way, went along beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be, will be,&rdquo; thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. &ldquo;So be it. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to her that all the evil memories in her head had taken
      shape and were walking beside her in the darkness, breathing heavily,
      while she, like a fly that had fallen into the inkpot, was crawling
      painfully along the pavement and smirching Laevsky&rsquo;s side and arm with
      blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Kirilin should do anything horrid, she thought, not he but she would be
      to blame for it. There was a time when no man would have talked to her as
      Kirilin had done, and she had torn up her security like a thread and
      destroyed it irrevocably&mdash;who was to blame for it? Intoxicated by her
      passions she had smiled at a complete stranger, probably just because he
      was tall and a fine figure. After two meetings she was weary of him, had
      thrown him over, and did not that, she thought now, give him the right to
      treat her as he chose?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ll say good-bye to you, darling,&rdquo; said Laevsky. &ldquo;Ilya Mihalitch
      will see you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to Kirilin, and, quickly crossing the boulevard, walked along
      the street to Sheshkovsky&rsquo;s, where there were lights in the windows, and
      then they heard the gate bang as he went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to have an explanation with you,&rdquo; said Kirilin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a boy,
      not some Atchkasov or Latchkasov, Zatchkasov. . . . I demand serious
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s heart began beating violently. She made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abrupt change in your behaviour to me I put down at first to
      coquetry,&rdquo; Kirilin went on; &ldquo;now I see that you don&rsquo;t know how to behave
      with gentlemanly people. You simply wanted to play with me, as you are
      playing with that wretched Armenian boy; but I&rsquo;m a gentleman and I insist
      on being treated like a gentleman. And so I am at your service. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m miserable,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna beginning to cry, and to hide
      her tears she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m miserable too,&rdquo; said Kirilin, &ldquo;but what of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kirilin was silent for a space, then he said distinctly and emphatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, madam, that if you do not give me an interview this evening,
      I&rsquo;ll make a scandal this very evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me off this evening,&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she did not
      recognise her own voice, it was so weak and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must give you a lesson. . . . Excuse me for the roughness of my tone,
      but it&rsquo;s necessary to give you a lesson. Yes, I regret to say I must give
      you a lesson. I insist on two interviews&mdash;to-day and to-morrow. After
      to-morrow you are perfectly free and can go wherever you like with any one
      you choose. To-day and to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went up to her gate and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she murmured, trembling all over and seeing nothing before
      her in the darkness but his white tunic. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right: I&rsquo;m a horrible
      woman. . . . I&rsquo;m to blame, but let me go . . . I beg you.&rdquo; She touched his
      cold hand and shuddered. &ldquo;I beseech you. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed Kirilin, &ldquo;alas! it&rsquo;s not part of my plan to let you go; I
      only mean to give you a lesson and make you realise. And what&rsquo;s more,
      madam, I&rsquo;ve too little faith in women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m miserable. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna listened to the even splash of the sea, looked at the
      sky studded with stars, and longed to make haste and end it all, and get
      away from the cursed sensation of life, with its sea, stars, men, fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only not in my home,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Take me somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to Muridov&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the old wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked quickly along the street and then turned into the side-street
      that led towards the mountains. It was dark. There were pale streaks of
      light here and there on the pavement, from the lighted windows, and it
      seemed to her that, like a fly, she kept falling into the ink and crawling
      out into the light again. At one point he stumbled, almost fell down and
      burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk,&rdquo; thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. &ldquo;Never mind. . . . Never mind.
      . . . So be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atchmianov, too, soon took leave of the party and followed Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna to ask her to go for a row. He went to her house and looked
      over the fence: the windows were wide open, there were no lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nadyezhda Fyodorovna!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment passed, he called again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he heard Olga&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she has not come in yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange . . . very strange,&rdquo; thought Atchmianov, feeling very uneasy.
      &ldquo;She went home. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the boulevard, then along the street, and glanced in at
      the windows of Sheshkovsky&rsquo;s. Laevsky was sitting at the table without his
      coat on, looking attentively at his cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange, strange,&rdquo; muttered Atchmianov, and remembering Laevsky&rsquo;s
      hysterics, he felt ashamed. &ldquo;If she is not at home, where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s lodgings again, and looked at the dark
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cheat, a cheat . . .&rdquo; he thought, remembering that, meeting him at
      midday at Marya Konstantinovna&rsquo;s, she had promised to go in a boat with
      him that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the house where Kirilin lived were dark, and there was a
      policeman sitting asleep on a little bench at the gate. Everything was
      clear to Atchmianov when he looked at the windows and the policeman. He
      made up his mind to go home, and set off in that direction, but somehow
      found himself near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna&rsquo;s lodgings again. He sat down on
      the bench near the gate and took off his hat, feeling that his head was
      burning with jealousy and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the town church only struck twice in the twenty-four hours&mdash;at
      midday and midnight. Soon after it struck midnight he heard hurried
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening, then, again at Muridov&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Atchmianov heard, and he
      recognised Kirilin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock; good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna made her appearance near the garden. Without noticing
      that Atchmianov was sitting on the bench, she passed beside him like a
      shadow, opened the gate, and leaving it open, went into the house. In her
      own room she lighted the candle and quickly undressed, but instead of
      getting into bed, she sank on her knees before a chair, flung her arms
      round it, and rested her head on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past two when Laevsky came home.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Having made up his mind to lie, not all at once but piecemeal, Laevsky
      went soon after one o&rsquo;clock next day to Samoylenko to ask for the money
      that he might be sure to get off on Saturday. After his hysterical attack,
      which had added an acute feeling of shame to his depressed state of mind,
      it was unthinkable to remain in the town. If Samoylenko should insist on
      his conditions, he thought it would be possible to agree to them and take
      the money, and next day, just as he was starting, to say that Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna refused to go. He would be able to persuade her that evening
      that the whole arrangement would be for her benefit. If Samoylenko, who
      was obviously under the influence of Von Koren, should refuse the money
      altogether or make fresh conditions, then he, Laevsky, would go off that
      very evening in a cargo vessel, or even in a sailing-boat, to Novy Athon
      or Novorossiisk, would send from there an humiliating telegram, and would
      stay there till his mother sent him the money for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went into Samoylenko&rsquo;s, he found Von Koren in the drawing-room.
      The zoologist had just arrived for dinner, and, as usual, was turning over
      the album and scrutinising the gentlemen in top-hats and the ladies in
      caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very unlucky!&rdquo; thought Laevsky, seeing him. &ldquo;He may be in the way.
      Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; answered Von Koren, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Alexandr Daviditch at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky went into the kitchen, but seeing from the door that Samoylenko
      was busy over the salad, he went back into the drawing-room and sat down.
      He always had a feeling of awkwardness in the zoologist&rsquo;s presence, and
      now he was afraid there would be talk about his attack of hysterics. There
      was more than a minute of silence. Von Koren suddenly raised his eyes to
      Laevsky and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel after yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well indeed,&rdquo; said Laevsky, flushing. &ldquo;It really was nothing much. .
      . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until yesterday I thought it was only ladies who had hysterics, and so at
      first I thought you had St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky smiled ingratiatingly, and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How indelicate on his part! He knows quite well how unpleasant it is for
      me. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was a ridiculous performance,&rdquo; he said, still smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      laughing over it the whole morning. What&rsquo;s so curious in an attack of
      hysterics is that you know it is absurd, and are laughing at it in your
      heart, and at the same time you sob. In our neurotic age we are the slaves
      of our nerves; they are our masters and do as they like with us.
      Civilisation has done us a bad turn in that way. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Laevsky talked, he felt it disagreeable that Von Koren listened to him
      gravely, and looked at him steadily and attentively as though studying
      him; and he was vexed with himself that in spite of his dislike of Von
      Koren, he could not banish the ingratiating smile from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must admit, though,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that there were immediate causes for
      the attack, and quite sufficient ones too. My health has been terribly
      shaky of late. To which one must add boredom, constantly being hard up . .
      . the absence of people and general interests . . . . My position is worse
      than a governor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your position is a hopeless one,&rdquo; answered Von Koren.
    </p>
    <p>
      These calm, cold words, implying something between a jeer and an uninvited
      prediction, offended Laevsky. He recalled the zoologist&rsquo;s eyes the evening
      before, full of mockery and disgust. He was silent for a space and then
      asked, no longer smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know anything of my position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were only just speaking of it yourself. Besides, your friends take
      such a warm interest in you, that I am hearing about you all day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friends? Samoylenko, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask Alexandr Daviditch and my friends in general not to trouble
      so much about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Samoylenko; you had better ask him not to trouble so much about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your tone,&rdquo; Laevsky muttered, suddenly feeling as
      though he had only just realised that the zoologist hated and despised
      him, and was jeering at him, and was his bitterest and most inveterate
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep that tone for some one else,&rdquo; he said softly, unable to speak aloud
      for the hatred with which his chest and throat were choking, as they had
      been the night before with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko came in in his shirt-sleeves, crimson and perspiring from the
      stifling kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you here?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-morning, my dear boy. Have you had dinner?
      Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony. Have you had dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandr Daviditch,&rdquo; said Laevsky, standing up, &ldquo;though I did appeal to
      you to help me in a private matter, it did not follow that I released you
      from the obligation of discretion and respect for other people&rsquo;s private
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Samoylenko, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have no money,&rdquo; Laevsky went on, raising his voice and shifting
      from one foot to the other in his excitement, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give it; refuse it.
      But why spread abroad in every back street that my position is hopeless,
      and all the rest of it? I can&rsquo;t endure such benevolence and friend&rsquo;s
      assistance where there&rsquo;s a shilling-worth of talk for a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of help!
      You can boast of your benevolence as much as you please, but no one has
      given you the right to gossip about my private affairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What private affairs?&rdquo; asked Samoylenko, puzzled and beginning to be
      angry. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come here to be abusive, you had better clear out. You
      can come again afterwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the rule that when one is angry with one&rsquo;s neighbour, one
      must begin to count a hundred, and one will grow calm again; and he began
      rapidly counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you not to trouble yourself about me,&rdquo; Laevsky went on. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay
      any attention to me, and whose business is it what I do and how I live?
      Yes, I want to go away. Yes, I get into debt, I drink, I am living with
      another man&rsquo;s wife, I&rsquo;m hysterical, I&rsquo;m ordinary. I am not so profound as
      some people, but whose business is that? Respect other people&rsquo;s privacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, brother,&rdquo; said Samoylenko, who had counted up to thirty-five,
      &ldquo;but . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respect other people&rsquo;s individuality!&rdquo; interrupted Laevsky. &ldquo;This
      continual gossip about other people&rsquo;s affairs, this sighing and groaning
      and everlasting prying, this eavesdropping, this friendly sympathy . . .
      damn it all! They lend me money and make conditions as though I were a
      schoolboy! I am treated as the devil knows what! I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo;
       shouted Laevsky, staggering with excitement and afraid that it might end
      in another attack of hysterics. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t get away on Saturday, then,&rdquo;
       flashed through his mind. &ldquo;I want nothing. All I ask of you is to spare me
      your protecting care. I&rsquo;m not a boy, and I&rsquo;m not mad, and I beg you to
      leave off looking after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon came in, and seeing Laevsky pale and gesticulating, addressing
      his strange speech to the portrait of Prince Vorontsov, stood still by the
      door as though petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This continual prying into my soul,&rdquo; Laevsky went on, &ldquo;is insulting to my
      human dignity, and I beg these volunteer detectives to give up their
      spying! Enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that . . . what did you say?&rdquo; said Samoylenko, who had counted up
      to a hundred. He turned crimson and went up to Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Laevsky, breathing hard and snatching up his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Russian doctor, a nobleman by birth, and a civil councillor,&rdquo; said
      Samoylenko emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been a spy, and I allow no one to
      insult me!&rdquo; he shouted in a breaking voice, emphasising the last word.
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon, who had never seen the doctor so majestic, so swelling with
      dignity, so crimson and so ferocious, shut his mouth, ran out into the
      entry and there exploded with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though through a fog, Laevsky saw Von Koren get up and, putting his
      hands in his trouser-pockets, stand still in an attitude of expectancy, as
      though waiting to see what would happen. This calm attitude struck Laevsky
      as insolent and insulting to the last degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly take back your words,&rdquo; shouted Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky, who did not by now remember what his words were, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone! I ask for nothing. All I ask is that you and German
      upstarts of Jewish origin should let me alone! Or I shall take steps to
      make you! I will fight you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we understand,&rdquo; said Von Koren, coming from behind the table. &ldquo;Mr.
      Laevsky wants to amuse himself with a duel before he goes away. I can give
      him that pleasure. Mr. Laevsky, I accept your challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A challenge,&rdquo; said Laevsky, in a low voice, going up to the zoologist and
      looking with hatred at his swarthy brow and curly hair. &ldquo;A challenge? By
      all means! I hate you! I hate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted. To-morrow morning early near Kerbalay&rsquo;s. I leave all details
      to your taste. And now, clear out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; Laevsky said softly, breathing hard. &ldquo;I have hated you a
      long while! A duel! Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get rid of him, Alexandr Daviditch, or else I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Von Koren.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bite me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren&rsquo;s cool tone calmed the doctor; he seemed suddenly to come to
      himself, to recover his reason; he put both arms round Laevsky&rsquo;s waist,
      and, leading him away from the zoologist, muttered in a friendly voice
      that shook with emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends . . . dear, good . . . you&rsquo;ve lost your tempers and that&rsquo;s
      enough . . . and that&rsquo;s enough, my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing his soft, friendly voice, Laevsky felt that something unheard of,
      monstrous, had just happened to him, as though he had been nearly run over
      by a train; he almost burst into tears, waved his hand, and ran out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To feel that one is hated, to expose oneself before the man who hates
      one, in the most pitiful, contemptible, helpless state. My God, how hard
      it is!&rdquo; he thought a little while afterwards as he sat in the pavilion,
      feeling as though his body were scarred by the hatred of which he had just
      been the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How coarse it is, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold water with brandy in it revived him. He vividly pictured Von Koren&rsquo;s
      calm, haughty face; his eyes the day before, his shirt like a rug, his
      voice, his white hand; and heavy, passionate, hungry hatred rankled in his
      breast and clamoured for satisfaction. In his thoughts he felled Von Koren
      to the ground, and trampled him underfoot. He remembered to the minutest
      detail all that had happened, and wondered how he could have smiled
      ingratiatingly to that insignificant man, and how he could care for the
      opinion of wretched petty people whom nobody knew, living in a miserable
      little town which was not, it seemed, even on the map, and of which not
      one decent person in Petersburg had heard. If this wretched little town
      suddenly fell into ruins or caught fire, the telegram with the news would
      be read in Russia with no more interest than an advertisement of the sale
      of second-hand furniture. Whether he killed Von Koren next day or left him
      alive, it would be just the same, equally useless and uninteresting.
      Better to shoot him in the leg or hand, wound him, then laugh at him, and
      let him, like an insect with a broken leg lost in the grass&mdash;let him
      be lost with his obscure sufferings in the crowd of insignificant people
      like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky went to Sheshkovsky, told him all about it, and asked him to be
      his second; then they both went to the superintendent of the postal
      telegraph department, and asked him, too, to be a second, and stayed to
      dinner with him. At dinner there was a great deal of joking and laughing.
      Laevsky made jests at his own expense, saying he hardly knew how to fire
      off a pistol, calling himself a royal archer and William Tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must give this gentleman a lesson . . .&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they sat down to cards. Laevsky played, drank wine, and
      thought that duelling was stupid and senseless, as it did not decide the
      question but only complicated it, but that it was sometimes impossible to
      get on without it. In the given case, for instance, one could not, of
      course, bring an action against Von Koren. And this duel was so far good
      in that it made it impossible for Laevsky to remain in the town
      afterwards. He got a little drunk and interested in the game, and felt at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the sun had set and it grew dark, he was possessed by a feeling
      of uneasiness. It was not fear at the thought of death, because while he
      was dining and playing cards, he had for some reason a confident belief
      that the duel would end in nothing; it was dread at the thought of
      something unknown which was to happen next morning for the first time in
      his life, and dread of the coming night. . . . He knew that the night
      would be long and sleepless, and that he would have to think not only of
      Von Koren and his hatred, but also of the mountain of lies which he had to
      get through, and which he had not strength or ability to dispense with. It
      was as though he had been taken suddenly ill; all at once he lost all
      interest in the cards and in people, grew restless, and began asking them
      to let him go home. He was eager to get into bed, to lie without moving,
      and to prepare his thoughts for the night. Sheshkovsky and the postal
      superintendent saw him home and went on to Von Koren&rsquo;s to arrange about
      the duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near his lodgings Laevsky met Atchmianov. The young man was breathless and
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking for you, Ivan Andreitch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I beg you to come
      quickly. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one wants to see you, some one you don&rsquo;t know, about very important
      business; he earnestly begs you to come for a minute. He wants to speak to
      you of something. . . . For him it&rsquo;s a question of life and death. . . .&rdquo;
       In his excitement Atchmianov spoke in a strong Armenian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me not to tell you his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m busy; to-morrow, if he likes. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you!&rdquo; Atchmianov was aghast. &ldquo;He wants to tell you something very
      important for you . . . very important! If you don&rsquo;t come, something
      dreadful will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange . . .&rdquo; muttered Laevsky, unable to understand why Atchmianov was
      so excited and what mysteries there could be in this dull, useless little
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he repeated in hesitation. &ldquo;Come along, though; I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atchmianov walked rapidly on ahead and Laevsky followed him. They walked
      down a street, then turned into an alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bore this is!&rdquo; said Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, one minute . . . it&rsquo;s near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Near the old rampart they went down a narrow alley between two empty
      enclosures, then they came into a sort of large yard and went towards a
      small house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Muridov&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why we&rsquo;ve come by the back yards I don&rsquo;t understand. We might have
      come by the street; it&rsquo;s nearer. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, never mind. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck Laevsky as strange, too, that Atchmianov led him to a back
      entrance, and motioned to him as though bidding him go quietly and hold
      his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, this way . . .&rdquo; said Atchmianov, cautiously opening the door
      and going into the passage on tiptoe. &ldquo;Quietly, quietly, I beg you . . .
      they may hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened, drew a deep breath and said in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open that door, and go in . . . don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky, puzzled, opened the door and went into a room with a low ceiling
      and curtained windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a candle on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked some one in the next room. &ldquo;Is it you, Muridov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky turned into that room and saw Kirilin, and beside him Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t hear what was said to him; he staggered back, and did not know
      how he found himself in the street. His hatred for Von Koren and his
      uneasiness&mdash;all had vanished from his soul. As he went home he waved
      his right arm awkwardly and looked carefully at the ground under his feet,
      trying to step where it was smooth. At home in his study he walked
      backwards and forwards, rubbing his hands, and awkwardly shrugging his
      shoulders and neck, as though his jacket and shirt were too tight; then he
      lighted a candle and sat down to the table. . . .
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;humane studies&rsquo; of which you speak will only satisfy human thought
      when, as they advance, they meet the exact sciences and progress side by
      side with them. Whether they will meet under a new microscope, or in the
      monologues of a new Hamlet, or in a new religion, I do not know, but I
      expect the earth will be covered with a crust of ice before it comes to
      pass. Of all humane learning the most durable and living is, of course,
      the teaching of Christ; but look how differently even that is interpreted!
      Some teach that we must love all our neighbours but make an exception of
      soldiers, criminals, and lunatics. They allow the first to be killed in
      war, the second to be isolated or executed, and the third they forbid to
      marry. Other interpreters teach that we must love all our neighbours
      without exception, with no distinction of <i>plus</i> or <i>minus</i>.
      According to their teaching, if a consumptive or a murderer or an
      epileptic asks your daughter in marriage, you must let him have her. If <i>crêtins</i>
      go to war against the physically and mentally healthy, don&rsquo;t defend
      yourselves. This advocacy of love for love&rsquo;s sake, like art for art&rsquo;s
      sake, if it could have power, would bring mankind in the long run to
      complete extinction, and so would become the vastest crime that has ever
      been committed upon earth. There are very many interpretations, and since
      there are many of them, serious thought is not satisfied by any one of
      them, and hastens to add its own individual interpretation to the mass.
      For that reason you should never put a question on a philosophical or
      so-called Christian basis; by so doing you only remove the question
      further from solution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon listened to the zoologist attentively, thought a little, and
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the philosophers invented the moral law which is innate in every
      man, or did God create it together with the body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But that law is so universal among all peoples and all ages
      that I fancy we ought to recognise it as organically connected with man.
      It is not invented, but exists and will exist. I don&rsquo;t tell you that one
      day it will be seen under the microscope, but its organic connection is
      shown, indeed, by evidence: serious affections of the brain and all
      so-called mental diseases, to the best of my belief, show themselves first
      of all in the perversion of the moral law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. So then, just as our stomach bids us eat, our moral sense bids us
      love our neighbours. Is that it? But our natural man through self-love
      opposes the voice of conscience and reason, and this gives rise to many
      brain-racking questions. To whom ought we to turn for the solution of
      those questions if you forbid us to put them on the philosophic basis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to what little exact science we have. Trust to evidence and the
      logic of facts. It is true it is but little, but, on the other hand, it is
      less fluid and shifting than philosophy. The moral law, let us suppose,
      demands that you love your neighbour. Well? Love ought to show itself in
      the removal of everything which in one way or another is injurious to men
      and threatens them with danger in the present or in the future. Our
      knowledge and the evidence tells us that the morally and physically
      abnormal are a menace to humanity. If so you must struggle against the
      abnormal; if you are not able to raise them to the normal standard you
      must have strength and ability to render them harmless&mdash;that is, to
      destroy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So love consists in the strong overcoming the weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know the strong crucified our Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; said the deacon
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is that those who crucified Him were not the strong but the
      weak. Human culture weakens and strives to nullify the struggle for
      existence and natural selection; hence the rapid advancement of the weak
      and their predominance over the strong. Imagine that you succeeded in
      instilling into bees humanitarian ideas in their crude and elementary
      form. What would come of it? The drones who ought to be killed would
      remain alive, would devour the honey, would corrupt and stifle the bees,
      resulting in the predominance of the weak over the strong and the
      degeneration of the latter. The same process is taking place now with
      humanity; the weak are oppressing the strong. Among savages untouched by
      civilisation the strongest, cleverest, and most moral takes the lead; he
      is the chief and the master. But we civilised men have crucified Christ,
      and we go on crucifying Him, so there is something lacking in us. . . .
      And that something one ought to raise up in ourselves, or there will be no
      end to these errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what criterion have you to distinguish the strong from the weak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowledge and evidence. The tuberculous and the scrofulous are recognised
      by their diseases, and the insane and the immoral by their actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mistakes may be made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s no use to be afraid of getting your feet wet when you are
      threatened with the deluge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s philosophy,&rdquo; laughed the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. You are so corrupted by your seminary philosophy that
      you want to see nothing but fog in everything. The abstract studies with
      which your youthful head is stuffed are called abstract just because they
      abstract your minds from what is obvious. Look the devil straight in the
      eye, and if he&rsquo;s the devil, tell him he&rsquo;s the devil, and don&rsquo;t go calling
      to Kant or Hegel for explanations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The zoologist paused and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice two&rsquo;s four, and a stone&rsquo;s a stone. Here to-morrow we have a duel.
      You and I will say it&rsquo;s stupid and absurd, that the duel is out of date,
      that there is no real difference between the aristocratic duel and the
      drunken brawl in the pot-house, and yet we shall not stop, we shall go
      there and fight. So there is some force stronger than our reasoning. We
      shout that war is plunder, robbery, atrocity, fratricide; we cannot look
      upon blood without fainting; but the French or the Germans have only to
      insult us for us to feel at once an exaltation of spirit; in the most
      genuine way we shout &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; and rush to attack the foe. You will invoke
      the blessing of God on our weapons, and our valour will arouse universal
      and general enthusiasm. Again it follows that there is a force, if not
      higher, at any rate stronger, than us and our philosophy. We can no more
      stop it than that cloud which is moving upwards over the sea. Don&rsquo;t be
      hypocritical, don&rsquo;t make a long nose at it on the sly; and don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;Ah,
      old-fashioned, stupid! Ah, it&rsquo;s inconsistent with Scripture!&rsquo; but look it
      straight in the face, recognise its rational lawfulness, and when, for
      instance, it wants to destroy a rotten, scrofulous, corrupt race, don&rsquo;t
      hinder it with your pilules and misunderstood quotations from the Gospel.
      Leskov has a story of a conscientious Danila who found a leper outside the
      town, and fed and warmed him in the name of love and of Christ. If that
      Danila had really loved humanity, he would have dragged the leper as far
      as possible from the town, and would have flung him in a pit, and would
      have gone to save the healthy. Christ, I hope, taught us a rational,
      intelligent, practical love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fellow you are!&rdquo; laughed the deacon. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in Christ.
      Why do you mention His name so often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do believe in Him. Only, of course, in my own way, not in yours.
      Oh, deacon, deacon!&rdquo; laughed the zoologist; he put his arm round the
      deacon&rsquo;s waist, and said gaily: &ldquo;Well? Are you coming with us to the duel
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders don&rsquo;t allow it, or else I should come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;orders&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been consecrated. I am in a state of grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, deacon, deacon,&rdquo; repeated Von Koren, laughing, &ldquo;I love talking to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you have faith,&rdquo; said the deacon. &ldquo;What sort of faith is it? Why,
      I have an uncle, a priest, and he believes so that when in time of drought
      he goes out into the fields to pray for rain, he takes his umbrella and
      leather overcoat for fear of getting wet through on his way home. That&rsquo;s
      faith! When he speaks of Christ, his face is full of radiance, and all the
      peasants, men and women, weep floods of tears. He would stop that cloud
      and put all those forces you talk about to flight. Yes . . . faith moves
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon laughed and slapped the zoologist on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes . . .&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;here you are teaching all the time, fathoming the
      depths of the ocean, dividing the weak and the strong, writing books and
      challenging to duels&mdash;and everything remains as it is; but, behold!
      some feeble old man will mutter just one word with a holy spirit, or a new
      Mahomet, with a sword, will gallop from Arabia, and everything will be
      topsy-turvy, and in Europe not one stone will be left standing upon
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, deacon, that&rsquo;s on the knees of the gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith without works is dead, but works without faith are worse still&mdash;mere
      waste of time and nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came into sight on the sea-front. He saw the deacon and the
      zoologist, and went up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe everything is ready,&rdquo; he said, breathing hard. &ldquo;Govorovsky and
      Boyko will be the seconds. They will start at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
      How it has clouded over,&rdquo; he said, looking at the sky. &ldquo;One can see
      nothing; there will be rain directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are coming with us?&rdquo; said the zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, God preserve me; I&rsquo;m worried enough as it is. Ustimovitch is going
      instead of me. I&rsquo;ve spoken to him already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far over the sea was a flash of lightning, followed by a hollow roll of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stifling it is before a storm!&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;ve been to
      Laevsky already and have been weeping on his bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go to him?&rdquo; answered the doctor in confusion. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before sunset he had walked several times along the boulevard and the
      street in the hope of meeting Laevsky. He was ashamed of his hastiness and
      the sudden outburst of friendliness which had followed it. He wanted to
      apologise to Laevsky in a joking tone, to give him a good talking to, to
      soothe him and to tell him that the duel was a survival of mediæval
      barbarism, but that Providence itself had brought them to the duel as a
      means of reconciliation; that the next day, both being splendid and highly
      intelligent people, they would, after exchanging shots, appreciate each
      other&rsquo;s noble qualities and would become friends. But he could not come
      across Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I go and see him for?&rdquo; repeated Samoylenko. &ldquo;I did not insult
      him; he insulted me. Tell me, please, why he attacked me. What harm had I
      done him? I go into the drawing-room, and, all of a sudden, without the
      least provocation: &lsquo;Spy!&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a nice thing! Tell me, how did it begin?
      What did you say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him his position was hopeless. And I was right. It is only honest
      men or scoundrels who can find an escape from any position, but one who
      wants to be at the same time an honest man and a scoundrel &mdash;it is a
      hopeless position. But it&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock, gentlemen, and we have to be
      up early to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden gust of wind; it blew up the dust on the sea-front,
      whirled it round in eddies, with a howl that drowned the roar of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A squall,&rdquo; said the deacon. &ldquo;We must go in, our eyes are getting full of
      dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they went, Samoylenko sighed and, holding his hat, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shan&rsquo;t sleep to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agitate yourself,&rdquo; laughed the zoologist. &ldquo;You can set your
      mind at rest; the duel will end in nothing. Laevsky will magnanimously
      fire into the air&mdash;he can do nothing else; and I daresay I shall not
      fire at all. To be arrested and lose my time on Laevsky&rsquo;s account&mdash;the
      game&rsquo;s not worth the candle. By the way, what is the punishment for
      duelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest, and in the case of the death of your opponent a maximum of three
      years&rsquo; imprisonment in the fortress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, in a military fortress, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though this fine gentleman ought to have a lesson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind them on the sea, there was a flash of lightning, which for an
      instant lighted up the roofs of the houses and the mountains. The friends
      parted near the boulevard. When the doctor disappeared in the darkness and
      his steps had died away, Von Koren shouted to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope the weather won&rsquo;t interfere with us to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely it will! Please God it may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the night? What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the roar of the wind and the sea and the crashes of thunder, it was
      difficult to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; shouted the zoologist, and hurried home.
    </p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;Upon my mind, weighed down with woe,
              Crowd thoughts, a heavy multitude:
              In silence memory unfolds
              Her long, long scroll before my eyes.
              Loathing and shuddering I curse
              And bitterly lament in vain,
              And bitter though the tears I weep
              I do not wash those lines away.&rdquo;

                                      PUSHKIN.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whether they killed him next morning, or mocked at him&mdash;that is, left
      him his life&mdash;he was ruined, anyway. Whether this disgraced woman
      killed herself in her shame and despair, or dragged on her pitiful
      existence, she was ruined anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thought Laevsky as he sat at the table late in the evening, still
      rubbing his hands. The windows suddenly blew open with a bang; a violent
      gust of wind burst into the room, and the papers fluttered from the table.
      Laevsky closed the windows and bent down to pick up the papers. He was
      aware of something new in his body, a sort of awkwardness he had not felt
      before, and his movements were strange to him. He moved timidly, jerking
      with his elbows and shrugging his shoulders; and when he sat down to the
      table again, he again began rubbing his hands. His body had lost its
      suppleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eve of death one ought to write to one&rsquo;s nearest relation. Laevsky
      thought of this. He took a pen and wrote with a tremulous hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to write to beg his mother, for the sake of the merciful God in
      whom she believed, that she would give shelter and bring a little warmth
      and kindness into the life of the unhappy woman who, by his doing, had
      been disgraced and was in solitude, poverty, and weakness, that she would
      forgive and forget everything, everything, everything, and by her
      sacrifice atone to some extent for her son&rsquo;s terrible sin. But he
      remembered how his mother, a stout, heavily-built old woman in a lace cap,
      used to go out into the garden in the morning, followed by her companion
      with the lap-dog; how she used to shout in a peremptory way to the
      gardener and the servants, and how proud and haughty her face was&mdash;he
      remembered all this and scratched out the word he had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vivid flash of lightning at all three windows, and it was
      followed by a prolonged, deafening roll of thunder, beginning with a
      hollow rumble and ending with a crash so violent that all the window-panes
      rattled. Laevsky got up, went to the window, and pressed his forehead
      against the pane. There was a fierce, magnificent storm. On the horizon
      lightning-flashes were flung in white streams from the storm-clouds into
      the sea, lighting up the high, dark waves over the far-away expanse. And
      to right and to left, and, no doubt, over the house too, the lightning
      flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm!&rdquo; whispered Laevsky; he had a longing to pray to some one or to
      something, if only to the lightning or the storm-clouds. &ldquo;Dear storm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered how as a boy he used to run out into the garden without a
      hat on when there was a storm, and how two fair-haired girls with blue
      eyes used to run after him, and how they got wet through with the rain;
      they laughed with delight, but when there was a loud peal of thunder, the
      girls used to nestle up to the boy confidingly, while he crossed himself
      and made haste to repeat: &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy. . . .&rdquo; Oh, where had they
      vanished to! In what sea were they drowned, those dawning days of pure,
      fair life? He had no fear of the storm, no love of nature now; he had no
      God. All the confiding girls he had ever known had by now been ruined by
      him and those like him. All his life he had not planted one tree in his
      own garden, nor grown one blade of grass; and living among the living, he
      had not saved one fly; he had done nothing but destroy and ruin, and lie,
      lie. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in my past was not vice?&rdquo; he asked himself, trying to clutch at some
      bright memory as a man falling down a precipice clutches at the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      School? The university? But that was a sham. He had neglected his work and
      forgotten what he had learnt. The service of his country? That, too, was a
      sham, for he did nothing in the Service, took a salary for doing nothing,
      and it was an abominable swindling of the State for which one was not
      punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no craving for truth, and had not sought it; spellbound by vice and
      lying, his conscience had slept or been silent. Like a stranger, like an
      alien from another planet, he had taken no part in the common life of men,
      had been indifferent to their sufferings, their ideas, their religion,
      their sciences, their strivings, and their struggles. He had not said one
      good word, not written one line that was not useless and vulgar; he had
      not done his fellows one ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of service, but had eaten their bread,
      drunk their wine, seduced their wives, lived on their thoughts, and to
      justify his contemptible, parasitic life in their eyes and in his own, he
      had always tried to assume an air of being higher and better than they.
      Lies, lies, lies. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He vividly remembered what he had seen that evening at Muridov&rsquo;s, and he
      was in an insufferable anguish of loathing and misery. Kirilin and
      Atchmianov were loathsome, but they were only continuing what he had
      begun; they were his accomplices and his disciples. This young weak woman
      had trusted him more than a brother, and he had deprived her of her
      husband, of her friends and of her country, and had brought her here&mdash;to
      the heat, to fever, and to boredom; and from day to day she was bound to
      reflect, like a mirror, his idleness, his viciousness and falsity&mdash;and
      that was all she had had to fill her weak, listless, pitiable life. Then
      he had grown sick of her, had begun to hate her, but had not had the pluck
      to abandon her, and he had tried to entangle her more and more closely in
      a web of lies. . . . These men had done the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky sat at the table, then got up and went to the window; at one
      minute he put out the candle and then he lighted it again. He cursed
      himself aloud, wept and wailed, and asked forgiveness; several times he
      ran to the table in despair, and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Except his mother, he had no relations or near friends; but how could his
      mother help him? And where was she? He had an impulse to run to Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, to fall at her feet, to kiss her hands and feet, to beg her
      forgiveness; but she was his victim, and he was afraid of her as though
      she were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life is ruined,&rdquo; he repeated, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Why am I still
      alive, my God! . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had cast out of heaven his dim star; it had fallen, and its track was
      lost in the darkness of night. It would never return to the sky again,
      because life was given only once and never came a second time. If he could
      have turned back the days and years of the past, he would have replaced
      the falsity with truth, the idleness with work, the boredom with
      happiness; he would have given back purity to those whom he had robbed of
      it. He would have found God and goodness, but that was as impossible as to
      put back the fallen star into the sky, and because it was impossible he
      was in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the storm was over, he sat by the open window and thought calmly of
      what was before him. Von Koren would most likely kill him. The man&rsquo;s
      clear, cold theory of life justified the destruction of the rotten and the
      useless; if it changed at the crucial moment, it would be the hatred and
      the repugnance that Laevsky inspired in him that would save him. If he
      missed his aim or, in mockery of his hated opponent, only wounded him, or
      fired in the air, what could he do then? Where could he go?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Petersburg?&rdquo; Laevsky asked himself. But that would mean beginning
      over again the old life which he cursed. And the man who seeks salvation
      in change of place like a migrating bird would find nothing anywhere, for
      all the world is alike to him. Seek salvation in men? In whom and how?
      Samoylenko&rsquo;s kindness and generosity could no more save him than the
      deacon&rsquo;s laughter or Von Koren&rsquo;s hatred. He must look for salvation in
      himself alone, and if there were no finding it, why waste time? He must
      kill himself, that was all. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the sound of a carriage. It was getting light. The carriage
      passed by, turned, and crunching on the wet sand, stopped near the house.
      There were two men in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute; I&rsquo;m coming directly,&rdquo; Laevsky said to them out of the
      window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asleep. Surely it&rsquo;s not time yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock. By the time we get there . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky put on his overcoat and cap, put some cigarettes in his pocket,
      and stood still hesitating. He felt as though there was something else he
      must do. In the street the seconds talked in low voices and the horses
      snorted, and this sound in the damp, early morning, when everybody was
      asleep and light was hardly dawning in the sky, filled Laevsky&rsquo;s soul with
      a disconsolate feeling which was like a presentiment of evil. He stood for
      a little, hesitating, and went into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was lying stretched out on the bed, wrapped from head
      to foot in a rug. She did not stir, and her whole appearance, especially
      her head, suggested an Egyptian mummy. Looking at her in silence, Laevsky
      mentally asked her forgiveness, and thought that if the heavens were not
      empty and there really were a God, then He would save her; if there were
      no God, then she had better perish&mdash;there was nothing for her to live
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she jumped up, and sat up in bed. Lifting her pale face and
      looking with horror at Laevsky, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you? Is the storm over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered; put both hands to her head and shuddered all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How miserable I am!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If only you knew how miserable I am! I
      expected,&rdquo; she went on, half closing her eyes, &ldquo;that you would kill me or
      turn me out of the house into the rain and storm, but you delay . . .
      delay . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Warmly and impulsively he put his arms round her and covered her knees and
      hands with kisses. Then when she muttered something and shuddered with the
      thought of the past, he stroked her hair, and looking into her face,
      realised that this unhappy, sinful woman was the one creature near and
      dear to him, whom no one could replace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went out of the house and got into the carriage he wanted to
      return home alive.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The deacon got up, dressed, took his thick, gnarled stick and slipped
      quietly out of the house. It was dark, and for the first minute when he
      went into the street, he could not even see his white stick. There was not
      a single star in the sky, and it looked as though there would be rain
      again. There was a smell of wet sand and sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped that the mountaineers won&rsquo;t attack us,&rdquo; thought the
      deacon, hearing the tap of the stick on the pavement, and noticing how
      loud and lonely the taps sounded in the stillness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got out of town, he began to see both the road and his stick. Here
      and there in the black sky there were dark cloudy patches, and soon a star
      peeped out and timidly blinked its one eye. The deacon walked along the
      high rocky coast and did not see the sea; it was slumbering below, and its
      unseen waves broke languidly and heavily on the shore, as though sighing
      &ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; and how slowly! One wave broke&mdash;the deacon had time to count
      eight steps; then another broke, and six steps; later a third. As before,
      nothing could be seen, and in the darkness one could hear the languid,
      drowsy drone of the sea. One could hear the infinitely faraway,
      inconceivable time when God moved above chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon felt uncanny. He hoped God would not punish him for keeping
      company with infidels, and even going to look at their duels. The duel
      would be nonsensical, bloodless, absurd, but however that might be, it was
      a heathen spectacle, and it was altogether unseemly for an ecclesiastical
      person to be present at it. He stopped and wondered&mdash;should he go
      back? But an intense, restless curiosity triumphed over his doubts, and he
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though they are infidels they are good people, and will be saved,&rdquo; he
      assured himself. &ldquo;They are sure to be saved,&rdquo; he said aloud, lighting a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what standard must one measure men&rsquo;s qualities, to judge rightly of
      them? The deacon remembered his enemy, the inspector of the clerical
      school, who believed in God, lived in chastity, and did not fight duels;
      but he used to feed the deacon on bread with sand in it, and on one
      occasion almost pulled off the deacon&rsquo;s ear. If human life was so
      artlessly constructed that every one respected this cruel and dishonest
      inspector who stole the Government flour, and his health and salvation
      were prayed for in the schools, was it just to shun such men as Von Koren
      and Laevsky, simply because they were unbelievers? The deacon was weighing
      this question, but he recalled how absurd Samoylenko had looked yesterday,
      and that broke the thread of his ideas. What fun they would have next day!
      The deacon imagined how he would sit under a bush and look on, and when
      Von Koren began boasting next day at dinner, he, the deacon, would begin
      laughing and telling him all the details of the duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know all about it?&rdquo; the zoologist would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are! I stayed at home, but I know all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be nice to write a comic description of the duel. His
      father-in-law would read it and laugh. A good story, told or written, was
      more than meat and drink to his father-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley of the Yellow River opened before him. The stream was broader
      and fiercer for the rain, and instead of murmuring as before, it was
      raging. It began to get light. The grey, dingy morning, and the clouds
      racing towards the west to overtake the storm-clouds, the mountains girt
      with mist, and the wet trees, all struck the deacon as ugly and sinister.
      He washed at the brook, repeated his morning prayer, and felt a longing
      for tea and hot rolls, with sour cream, which were served every morning at
      his father-in-law&rsquo;s. He remembered his wife and the &ldquo;Days past Recall,&rdquo;
       which she played on the piano. What sort of woman was she? His wife had
      been introduced, betrothed, and married to him all in one week: he had
      lived with her less than a month when he was ordered here, so that he had
      not had time to find out what she was like. All the same, he rather missed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must write her a nice letter . . .&rdquo; he thought. The flag on the <i>duhan</i>
      hung limp, soaked by the rain, and the <i>duhan</i> itself with its wet
      roof seemed darker and lower than it had been before. Near the door was
      standing a cart; Kerbalay, with two mountaineers and a young Tatar woman
      in trousers&mdash;no doubt Kerbalay&rsquo;s wife or daughter&mdash;were bringing
      sacks of something out of the <i>duhan</i>, and putting them on maize
      straw in the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the cart stood a pair of asses hanging their heads. When they had put
      in all the sacks, the mountaineers and the Tatar woman began covering them
      over with straw, while Kerbalay began hurriedly harnessing the asses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smuggling, perhaps,&rdquo; thought the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the fallen tree with the dried pine-needles, here was the
      blackened patch from the fire. He remembered the picnic and all its
      incidents, the fire, the singing of the mountaineers, his sweet dreams of
      becoming a bishop, and of the Church procession. . . . The Black River had
      grown blacker and broader with the rain. The deacon walked cautiously over
      the narrow bridge, which by now was reached by the topmost crests of the
      dirty water, and went up through the little copse to the drying-shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A splendid head,&rdquo; he thought, stretching himself on the straw, and
      thinking of Von Koren. &ldquo;A fine head&mdash;God grant him health; only there
      is cruelty in him. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did he hate Laevsky and Laevsky hate him? Why were they going to fight
      a duel? If from their childhood they had known poverty as the deacon had;
      if they had been brought up among ignorant, hard-hearted, grasping, coarse
      and ill-mannered people who grudged you a crust of bread, who spat on the
      floor and hiccoughed at dinner and at prayers; if they had not been spoilt
      from childhood by the pleasant surroundings and the select circle of
      friends they lived in&mdash;how they would have rushed at each other, how
      readily they would have overlooked each other&rsquo;s shortcomings and would
      have prized each other&rsquo;s strong points! Why, how few even outwardly decent
      people there were in the world! It was true that Laevsky was flighty,
      dissipated, queer, but he did not steal, did not spit loudly on the floor;
      he did not abuse his wife and say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll eat till you burst, but you
      don&rsquo;t want to work;&rdquo; he would not beat a child with reins, or give his
      servants stinking meat to eat&mdash; surely this was reason enough to be
      indulgent to him? Besides, he was the chief sufferer from his failings,
      like a sick man from his sores. Instead of being led by boredom and some
      sort of misunderstanding to look for degeneracy, extinction, heredity, and
      other such incomprehensible things in each other, would they not do better
      to stoop a little lower and turn their hatred and anger where whole
      streets resounded with moanings from coarse ignorance, greed, scolding,
      impurity, swearing, the shrieks of women. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a carriage interrupted the deacon&rsquo;s thoughts. He glanced out
      of the door and saw a carriage and in it three persons: Laevsky,
      Sheshkovsky, and the superintendent of the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Sheshkovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three got out of the carriage and looked at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not here yet,&rdquo; said Sheshkovsky, shaking the mud off. &ldquo;Well?
      Till the show begins, let us go and find a suitable spot; there&rsquo;s not room
      to turn round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went further up the river and soon vanished from sight. The Tatar
      driver sat in the carriage with his head resting on his shoulder and fell
      asleep. After waiting ten minutes the deacon came out of the drying-shed,
      and taking off his black hat that he might not be noticed, he began
      threading his way among the bushes and strips of maize along the bank,
      crouching and looking about him. The grass and maize were wet, and big
      drops fell on his head from the trees and bushes. &ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo; he
      muttered, picking up his wet and muddy skirt. &ldquo;Had I realised it, I would
      not have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon he heard voices and caught sight of them. Laevsky was walking rapidly
      to and fro in the small glade with bowed back and hands thrust in his
      sleeves; his seconds were standing at the water&rsquo;s edge, rolling
      cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; thought the deacon, not recognising Laevsky&rsquo;s walk; &ldquo;he looks
      like an old man. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How rude it is of them!&rdquo; said the superintendent of the post-office,
      looking at his watch. &ldquo;It may be learned manners to be late, but to my
      thinking it&rsquo;s hoggish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheshkovsky, a stout man with a black beard, listened and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      XIX
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time in my life I&rsquo;ve seen it! How glorious!&rdquo; said Von
      Koren, pointing to the glade and stretching out his hands to the east.
      &ldquo;Look: green rays!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the east behind the mountains rose two green streaks of light, and it
      really was beautiful. The sun was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; the zoologist went on, nodding to Laevsky&rsquo;s seconds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not late, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was followed by his seconds, Boyko and Govorovsky, two very young
      officers of the same height, wearing white tunics, and Ustimovitch, the
      thin, unsociable doctor; in one hand he had a bag of some sort, and in the
      other hand, as usual, a cane which he held behind him. Laying the bag on
      the ground and greeting no one, he put the other hand, too, behind his
      back and began pacing up and down the glade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky felt the exhaustion and awkwardness of a man who is soon perhaps
      to die, and is for that reason an object of general attention. He wanted
      to be killed as soon as possible or taken home. He saw the sunrise now for
      the first time in his life; the early morning, the green rays of light,
      the dampness, and the men in wet boots, seemed to him to have nothing to
      do with his life, to be superfluous and embarrassing. All this had no
      connection with the night he had been through, with his thoughts and his
      feeling of guilt, and so he would have gladly gone away without waiting
      for the duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren was noticeably excited and tried to conceal it, pretending that
      he was more interested in the green light than anything. The seconds were
      confused, and looked at one another as though wondering why they were here
      and what they were to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine, gentlemen, there is no need for us to go further,&rdquo; said
      Sheshkovsky. &ldquo;This place will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Von Koren agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Ustimovitch, pacing to and fro, suddenly turned
      sharply to Laevsky and said in a low voice, breathing into his face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have very likely not told you my terms yet. Each side is to pay me
      fifteen roubles, and in the case of the death of one party, the survivor
      is to pay thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky was already acquainted with the man, but now for the first time he
      had a distinct view of his lustreless eyes, his stiff moustaches, and
      wasted, consumptive neck; he was a money-grubber, not a doctor; his breath
      had an unpleasant smell of beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people there are in the world!&rdquo; thought Laevsky, and answered: &ldquo;Very
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded and began pacing to and fro again, and it was evident he
      did not need the money at all, but simply asked for it from hatred. Every
      one felt it was time to begin, or to end what had been begun, but instead
      of beginning or ending, they stood about, moved to and fro and smoked. The
      young officers, who were present at a duel for the first time in their
      lives, and even now hardly believed in this civilian and, to their
      thinking, unnecessary duel, looked critically at their tunics and stroked
      their sleeves. Sheshkovsky went up to them and said softly: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we
      must use every effort to prevent this duel; they ought to be reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed crimson and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirilin was at my rooms last night complaining that Laevsky had found him
      with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we know that too,&rdquo; said Boyko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, then . . . Laevsky&rsquo;s hands are trembling and all that sort
      of thing . . . he can scarcely hold a pistol now. To fight with him is as
      inhuman as to fight a man who is drunk or who has typhoid. If a
      reconciliation cannot be arranged, we ought to put off the duel,
      gentlemen, or something. . . . It&rsquo;s such a sickening business, I can&rsquo;t
      bear to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk to Von Koren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the rules of duelling, damnation take them, and I don&rsquo;t want
      to either; perhaps he&rsquo;ll imagine Laevsky funks it and has sent me to him,
      but he can think what he likes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheshkovsky hesitatingly walked up to Von Koren with a slight limp, as
      though his leg had gone to sleep; and as he went towards him, clearing his
      throat, his whole figure was a picture of indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I must say to you, sir,&rdquo; he began, carefully
      scrutinising the flowers on the zoologist&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s confidential. I
      don&rsquo;t know the rules of duelling, damnation take them, and I don&rsquo;t want
      to, and I look on the matter not as a second and that sort of thing, but
      as a man, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When seconds suggest reconciliation they are usually not listened to; it
      is looked upon as a formality. <i>Amour propre</i> and all that. But I
      humbly beg you to look carefully at Ivan Andreitch. He&rsquo;s not in a normal
      state, so to speak, to-day&mdash;not in his right mind, and a pitiable
      object. He has had a misfortune. I can&rsquo;t endure gossip. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheshkovsky flushed crimson and looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in view of the duel, I think it necessary to inform you, Laevsky
      found his madam last night at Muridov&rsquo;s with . . . another gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How disgusting!&rdquo; muttered the zoologist; he turned pale, frowned, and
      spat loudly. &ldquo;Tfoo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lower lip quivered, he walked away from Sheshkovsky, unwilling to hear
      more, and as though he had accidentally tasted something bitter, spat
      loudly again, and for the first time that morning looked with hatred at
      Laevsky. His excitement and awkwardness passed off; he tossed his head and
      said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, what are we waiting for, I should like to know? Why don&rsquo;t we
      begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheshkovsky glanced at the officers and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said aloud, addressing no one in particular. &ldquo;Gentlemen,
      we propose that you should be reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make haste and get the formalities over,&rdquo; said Von Koren.
      &ldquo;Reconciliation has been discussed already. What is the next formality?
      Make haste, gentlemen, time won&rsquo;t wait for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we insist on reconciliation all the same,&rdquo; said Sheshkovsky in a
      guilty voice, as a man compelled to interfere in another man&rsquo;s business;
      he flushed, laid his hand on his heart, and went on: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we see no
      grounds for associating the offence with the duel. There&rsquo;s nothing in
      common between duelling and offences against one another of which we are
      sometimes guilty through human weakness. You are university men and men of
      culture, and no doubt you see in the duel nothing but a foolish and
      out-of-date formality, and all that sort of thing. That&rsquo;s how we look at
      it ourselves, or we shouldn&rsquo;t have come, for we cannot allow that in our
      presence men should fire at one another, and all that.&rdquo; Sheshkovsky wiped
      the perspiration off his face and went on: &ldquo;Make an end to your
      misunderstanding, gentlemen; shake hands, and let us go home and drink to
      peace. Upon my honour, gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren did not speak. Laevsky, seeing that they were looking at him,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing against Nikolay Vassilitch; if he considers I&rsquo;m to blame,
      I&rsquo;m ready to apologise to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren was offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you want Mr. Laevsky to return home
      a magnanimous and chivalrous figure, but I cannot give you and him that
      satisfaction. And there was no need to get up early and drive eight miles
      out of town simply to drink to peace, to have breakfast, and to explain to
      me that the duel is an out-of-date formality. A duel is a duel, and there
      is no need to make it more false and stupid than it is in reality. I want
      to fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Boyko took a pair of pistols out of a box; one was
      given to Von Koren and one to Laevsky, and then there followed a
      difficulty which afforded a brief amusement to the zoologist and the
      seconds. It appeared that of all the people present not one had ever in
      his life been at a duel, and no one knew precisely how they ought to
      stand, and what the seconds ought to say and do. But then Boyko remembered
      and began, with a smile, to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, who remembers the description in Lermontov?&rdquo; asked Von Koren,
      laughing. &ldquo;In Turgenev, too, Bazarov had a duel with some one. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to remember,&rdquo; said Ustimovitch impatiently. &ldquo;Measure the
      distance, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took three steps as though to show how to measure it. Boyko counted
      out the steps while his companion drew his sabre and scratched the earth
      at the extreme points to mark the barrier. In complete silence the
      opponents took their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moles,&rdquo; the deacon thought, sitting in the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheshkovsky said something, Boyko explained something again, but Laevsky
      did not hear&mdash;or rather heard, but did not understand. He cocked his
      pistol when the time came to do so, and raised the cold, heavy weapon with
      the barrel upwards. He forgot to unbutton his overcoat, and it felt very
      tight over his shoulder and under his arm, and his arm rose as awkwardly
      as though the sleeve had been cut out of tin. He remembered the hatred he
      had felt the night before for the swarthy brow and curly hair, and felt
      that even yesterday at the moment of intense hatred and anger he could not
      have shot a man. Fearing that the bullet might somehow hit Von Koren by
      accident, he raised the pistol higher and higher, and felt that this too
      obvious magnanimity was indelicate and anything but magnanimous, but he
      did not know how else to do and could do nothing else. Looking at the
      pale, ironically smiling face of Von Koren, who evidently had been
      convinced from the beginning that his opponent would fire in the air,
      Laevsky thought that, thank God, everything would be over directly, and
      all that he had to do was to press the trigger rather hard. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a violent shock on the shoulder; there was the sound of a shot and
      an answering echo in the mountains: ping-ting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren cocked his pistol and looked at Ustimovitch, who was pacing as
      before with his hands behind his back, taking no notice of any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the zoologist, &ldquo;be so good as not to move to and fro like a
      pendulum. You make me dizzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stood still. Von Koren began to take aim at Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; thought Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrel of the pistol aimed straight at his face, the expression of
      hatred and contempt in Von Koren&rsquo;s attitude and whole figure, and the
      murder just about to be committed by a decent man in broad daylight, in
      the presence of decent men, and the stillness and the unknown force that
      compelled Laevsky to stand still and not to run &mdash;how mysterious it
      all was, how incomprehensible and terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment while Von Koren was taking aim seemed to Laevsky longer than a
      night: he glanced imploringly at the seconds; they were pale and did not
      stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste and fire,&rdquo; thought Laevsky, and felt that his pale, quivering,
      and pitiful face must arouse even greater hatred in Von Koren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill him directly,&rdquo; thought Von Koren, aiming at his forehead, with
      his finger already on the catch. &ldquo;Yes, of course I&rsquo;ll kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo; A despairing shout was suddenly heard somewhere very
      close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shot rang out at once. Seeing that Laevsky remained standing where he
      was and did not fall, they all looked in the direction from which the
      shout had come, and saw the deacon. With pale face and wet hair sticking
      to his forehead and his cheeks, wet through and muddy, he was standing in
      the maize on the further bank, smiling rather queerly and waving his wet
      hat. Sheshkovsky laughed with joy, burst into tears, and moved away. . . .
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      A little while afterwards, Von Koren and the deacon met near the little
      bridge. The deacon was excited; he breathed hard, and avoided looking in
      people&rsquo;s faces. He felt ashamed both of his terror and his muddy, wet
      garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you meant to kill him . . .&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How contrary to
      human nature it is! How utterly unnatural it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you come here?&rdquo; asked the zoologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; said the deacon, waving his hand. &ldquo;The evil one tempted me,
      saying: &lsquo;Go, go. . . .&rsquo; So I went and almost died of fright in the maize.
      But now, thank God, thank God. . . . I am awfully pleased with you,&rdquo;
       muttered the deacon. &ldquo;Old Grandad Tarantula will be glad . . . . It&rsquo;s
      funny, it&rsquo;s too funny! Only I beg of you most earnestly don&rsquo;t tell anybody
      I was there, or I may get into hot water with the authorities. They will
      say: &lsquo;The deacon was a second.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Von Koren, &ldquo;the deacon asks you not to tell any one
      you&rsquo;ve seen him here. He might get into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How contrary to human nature it is!&rdquo; sighed the deacon. &ldquo;Excuse my saying
      so, but your face was so dreadful that I thought you were going to kill
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very much tempted to put an end to that scoundrel,&rdquo; said Von Koren,
      &ldquo;but you shouted close by, and I missed my aim. The whole procedure is
      revolting to any one who is not used to it, and it has exhausted me,
      deacon. I feel awfully tired. Come along. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must let me walk back. I must get dry, for I am wet and cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you like,&rdquo; said the zoologist, in a weary tone, feeling
      dispirited, and, getting into the carriage, he closed his eyes. &ldquo;As you
      like. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were moving about the carriages and taking their seats,
      Kerbalay stood in the road, and, laying his hands on his stomach, he bowed
      low, showing his teeth; he imagined that the gentry had come to enjoy the
      beauties of nature and drink tea, and could not understand why they were
      getting into the carriages. The party set off in complete silence and only
      the deacon was left by the <i>duhan</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the <i>duhan</i>, drink tea,&rdquo; he said to Kerbalay. &ldquo;Me wants to
      eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kerbalay spoke good Russian, but the deacon imagined that the Tatar would
      understand him better if he talked to him in broken Russian. &ldquo;Cook
      omelette, give cheese. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, father,&rdquo; said Kerbalay, bowing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you everything . .
      . . I&rsquo;ve cheese and wine. . . . Eat what you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is &lsquo;God&rsquo; in Tatar?&rdquo; asked the deacon, going into the <i>duhan</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your God and my God are the same,&rdquo; said Kerbalay, not understanding him.
      &ldquo;God is the same for all men, only men are different. Some are Russian,
      some are Turks, some are English&mdash;there are many sorts of men, but
      God is one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. If all men worship the same God, why do you Mohammedans look
      upon Christians as your everlasting enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you angry?&rdquo; said Kerbalay, laying both hands on his stomach. &ldquo;You
      are a priest; I am a Mussulman: you say, &lsquo;I want to eat&rsquo;&mdash;I give it
      you. . . . Only the rich man distinguishes your God from my God; for the
      poor man it is all the same. If you please, it is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this theological conversation was taking place at the <i>duhan</i>,
      Laevsky was driving home thinking how dreadful it had been driving there
      at daybreak, when the roads, the rocks, and the mountains were wet and
      dark, and the uncertain future seemed like a terrible abyss, of which one
      could not see the bottom; while now the raindrops hanging on the grass and
      on the stones were sparkling in the sun like diamonds, nature was smiling
      joyfully, and the terrible future was left behind. He looked at
      Sheshkovsky&rsquo;s sullen, tear-stained face, and at the two carriages ahead of
      them in which Von Koren, his seconds, and the doctor were sitting, and it
      seemed to him as though they were all coming back from a graveyard in
      which a wearisome, insufferable man who was a burden to others had just
      been buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is over,&rdquo; he thought of his past, cautiously touching his neck
      with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right side of his neck was a small swelling, of the length and
      breadth of his little finger, and he felt a pain, as though some one had
      passed a hot iron over his neck. The bullet had bruised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when he got home, a strange, long, sweet day began for him,
      misty as forgetfulness. Like a man released from prison or from hospital,
      he stared at the long-familiar objects and wondered that the tables, the
      windows, the chairs, the light, and the sea stirred in him a keen,
      childish delight such as he had not known for long, long years. Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, pale and haggard, could not understand his gentle voice and
      strange movements; she made haste to tell him everything that had happened
      to her. . . . It seemed to her that very likely he scarcely heard and did
      not understand her, and that if he did know everything he would curse her
      and kill her, but he listened to her, stroked her face and hair, looked
      into her eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nobody but you. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they sat a long while in the garden, huddled close together, saying
      nothing, or dreaming aloud of their happy life in the future, in brief,
      broken sentences, while it seemed to him that he had never spoken at such
      length or so eloquently.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXI
    </h3>
    <p>
      More than three months had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came that Von Koren had fixed on for his departure. A cold, heavy
      rain had been falling from early morning, a north-east wind was blowing,
      and the waves were high on the sea. It was said that the steamer would
      hardly be able to come into the harbour in such weather. By the time-table
      it should have arrived at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but Von Koren, who
      had gone on to the sea-front at midday and again after dinner, could see
      nothing through the field-glass but grey waves and rain covering the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the day the rain ceased and the wind began to drop
      perceptibly. Von Koren had already made up his mind that he would not be
      able to get off that day, and had settled down to play chess with
      Samoylenko; but after dark the orderly announced that there were lights on
      the sea and that a rocket had been seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren made haste. He put his satchel over his shoulder, and kissed
      Samoylenko and the deacon. Though there was not the slightest necessity,
      he went through the rooms again, said good-bye to the orderly and the
      cook, and went out into the street, feeling that he had left something
      behind, either at the doctor&rsquo;s or his lodging. In the street he walked
      beside Samoylenko, behind them came the deacon with a box, and last of all
      the orderly with two portmanteaus. Only Samoylenko and the orderly could
      distinguish the dim lights on the sea. The others gazed into the darkness
      and saw nothing. The steamer had stopped a long way from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, make haste,&rdquo; Von Koren hurried them. &ldquo;I am afraid it will set
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they passed the little house with three windows, into which Laevsky had
      moved soon after the duel, Von Koren could not resist peeping in at the
      window. Laevsky was sitting, writing, bent over the table, with his back
      to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at him!&rdquo; said the zoologist softly. &ldquo;What a screw he has put on
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one may well wonder,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;He sits from morning till
      night, he&rsquo;s always at work. He works to pay off his debts. And he lives,
      brother, worse than a beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute of silence followed. The zoologist, the doctor, and the
      deacon stood at the window and went on looking at Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he didn&rsquo;t get away from here, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;Do you
      remember how hard he tried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has put a screw on himself,&rdquo; Von Koren repeated. &ldquo;His marriage,
      the way he works all day long for his daily bread, a new expression in his
      face, and even in his walk&mdash;it&rsquo;s all so extraordinary that I don&rsquo;t
      know what to call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The zoologist took Samoylenko&rsquo;s sleeve and went on with emotion in his
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell him and his wife that when I went away I was full of admiration
      for them and wished them all happiness . . . and I beg him, if he can, not
      to remember evil against me. He knows me. He knows that if I could have
      foreseen this change, then I might have become his best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in and say good-bye to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? God knows, perhaps you&rsquo;ll never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The zoologist reflected, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko tapped softly at the window. Laevsky started and looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you,&rdquo; said Samoylenko.
      &ldquo;He is just going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky got up from the table, and went into the passage to open the door.
      Samoylenko, the zoologist, and the deacon went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only come for one minute,&rdquo; began the zoologist, taking off his
      goloshes in the passage, and already wishing he had not given way to his
      feelings and come in, uninvited. &ldquo;It is as though I were forcing myself on
      him,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for disturbing you,&rdquo; he said as he went into the room with
      Laevsky, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m just going away, and I had an impulse to see you. God
      knows whether we shall ever meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to see you. . . . Please come in,&rdquo; said Laevsky, and he
      awkwardly set chairs for his visitors as though he wanted to bar their
      way, and stood in the middle of the room, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have done better to have left my audience in the street,&rdquo;
       thought Von Koren, and he said firmly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remember evil against me,
      Ivan Andreitch. To forget the past is, of course, impossible &mdash;it is
      too painful, and I&rsquo;ve not come here to apologise or to declare that I was
      not to blame. I acted sincerely, and I have not changed my convictions
      since then. . . . It is true that I see, to my great delight, that I was
      mistaken in regard to you, but it&rsquo;s easy to make a false step even on a
      smooth road, and, in fact, it&rsquo;s the natural human lot: if one is not
      mistaken in the main, one is mistaken in the details. Nobody knows the
      real truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no one knows the truth,&rdquo; said Laevsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye. . . . God give you all happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren gave Laevsky his hand; the latter took it and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remember evil against me,&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;Give my greetings to
      your wife, and say I am very sorry not to say good-bye to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laevsky went to the door of the next room, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nadya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came in; she stopped near the doorway and looked
      shyly at the visitors. There was a look of guilt and dismay on her face,
      and she held her hands like a schoolgirl receiving a scolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going away, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,&rdquo; said Von Koren, &ldquo;and have
      come to say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand uncertainly, while Laevsky bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pitiful figures they are, though!&rdquo; thought Von Koren. &ldquo;The life they
      are living does not come easy to them. I shall be in Moscow and
      Petersburg; can I send you anything?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she looked anxiously at her husband.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing . . .&rdquo; said Laevsky, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Our greetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren did not know what he could or ought to say, though as he went in
      he thought he would say a very great deal that would be warm and good and
      important. He shook hands with Laevsky and his wife in silence, and left
      them with a depressed feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people!&rdquo; said the deacon in a low voice, as he walked behind them.
      &ldquo;My God, what people! Of a truth, the right hand of God has planted this
      vine! Lord! Lord! One man vanquishes thousands and another tens of
      thousands. Nikolay Vassilitch,&rdquo; he said ecstatically, &ldquo;let me tell you
      that to-day you have conquered the greatest of man&rsquo;s enemies&mdash;pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, deacon! Fine conquerors we are! Conquerors ought to look like
      eagles, while he&rsquo;s a pitiful figure, timid, crushed; he bows like a
      Chinese idol, and I, I am sad. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard steps behind them. It was Laevsky, hurrying after them to see
      him off. The orderly was standing on the quay with the two portmanteaus,
      and at a little distance stood four boatmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a wind, though. . . . Brrr!&rdquo; said Samoylenko. &ldquo;There must be a
      pretty stiff storm on the sea now! You are not going off at a nice time,
      Koyla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of sea-sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. . . . I only hope these rascals won&rsquo;t upset you.
      You ought to have crossed in the agent&rsquo;s sloop. Where&rsquo;s the agent&rsquo;s
      sloop?&rdquo; he shouted to the boatmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gone, Your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Customs-house boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s gone, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let us know,&rdquo; said Samoylenko angrily. &ldquo;You dolts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same, don&rsquo;t worry yourself . . .&rdquo; said Von Koren. &ldquo;Well,
      good-bye. God keep you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samoylenko embraced Von Koren and made the sign of the cross over him
      three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us, Kolya. . . . Write. . . . We shall look out for you next
      spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, deacon,&rdquo; said Von Koren, shaking hands with the deacon. &ldquo;Thank
      you for your company and for your pleasant conversation. Think about the
      expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord, yes! to the ends of the earth,&rdquo; laughed the deacon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      nothing against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Koren recognised Laevsky in the darkness, and held out his hand
      without speaking. The boatmen were by now below, holding the boat, which
      was beating against the piles, though the breakwater screened it from the
      breakers. Von Koren went down the ladder, jumped into the boat, and sat at
      the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write!&rdquo; Samoylenko shouted to him. &ldquo;Take care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows the real truth,&rdquo; thought Laevsky, turning up the collar of
      his coat and thrusting his hands into his sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat turned briskly out of the harbour into the open sea. It vanished
      in the waves, but at once from a deep hollow glided up onto a high
      breaker, so that they could distinguish the men and even the oars. The
      boat moved three yards forward and was sucked two yards back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write!&rdquo; shouted Samoylenko; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s devilish weather for you to go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no one knows the real truth . . .&rdquo; thought Laevsky, looking wearily
      at the dark, restless sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It flings the boat back,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;she makes two steps forward and
      one step back; but the boatmen are stubborn, they work the oars
      unceasingly, and are not afraid of the high waves. The boat goes on and
      on. Now she is out of sight, but in half an hour the boatmen will see the
      steamer lights distinctly, and within an hour they will be by the steamer
      ladder. So it is in life. . . . In the search for truth man makes two
      steps forward and one step back. Suffering, mistakes, and weariness of
      life thrust them back, but the thirst for truth and stubborn will drive
      them on and on. And who knows? Perhaps they will reach the real truth at
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go&mdash;o&mdash;od-by&mdash;e,&rdquo; shouted Samoylenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sight or sound of them,&rdquo; said the deacon. &ldquo;Good luck on the
      journey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It began to spot with rain.

      EXCELLENT PEOPLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE upon a time
      there lived in Moscow a man called Vladimir Semyonitch Liadovsky. He took
      his degree at the university in the faculty of law and had a post on the
      board of management of some railway; but if you had asked him what his
      work was, he would look candidly and openly at you with his large bright
      eyes through his gold pincenez, and would answer in a soft, velvety,
      lisping baritone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My work is literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After completing his course at the university, Vladimir Semyonitch had had
      a paragraph of theatrical criticism accepted by a newspaper. From this
      paragraph he passed on to reviewing, and a year later he had advanced to
      writing a weekly article on literary matters for the same paper. But it
      does not follow from these facts that he was an amateur, that his literary
      work was of an ephemeral, haphazard character. Whenever I saw his neat
      spare figure, his high forehead and long mane of hair, when I listened to
      his speeches, it always seemed to me that his writing, quite apart from
      what and how he wrote, was something organically part of him, like the
      beating of his heart, and that his whole literary programme must have been
      an integral part of his brain while he was a baby in his mother&rsquo;s womb.
      Even in his walk, his gestures, his manner of shaking off the ash from his
      cigarette, I could read this whole programme from A to Z, with all its
      claptrap, dulness, and honourable sentiments. He was a literary man all
      over when with an inspired face he laid a wreath on the coffin of some
      celebrity, or with a grave and solemn face collected signatures for some
      address; his passion for making the acquaintance of distinguished literary
      men, his faculty for finding talent even where it was absent, his
      perpetual enthusiasm, his pulse that went at one hundred and twenty a
      minute, his ignorance of life, the genuinely feminine flutter with which
      he threw himself into concerts and literary evenings for the benefit of
      destitute students, the way in which he gravitated towards the young&mdash;all
      this would have created for him the reputation of a writer even if he had
      not written his articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those writers to whom phrases like, &ldquo;We are but few,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;What would life be without strife? Forward!&rdquo; were pre-eminently becoming,
      though he never strove with any one and never did go forward. It did not
      even sound mawkish when he fell to discoursing of ideals. Every
      anniversary of the university, on St. Tatiana&rsquo;s Day, he got drunk, chanted
      <i>Gaudeamus</i> out of tune, and his beaming and perspiring countenance
      seemed to say: &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;m drunk; I&rsquo;m keeping it up!&rdquo; But even that suited
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vladimir Semyonitch had genuine faith in his literary vocation and his
      whole programme. He had no doubts, and was evidently very well pleased
      with himself. Only one thing grieved him&mdash;the paper for which he
      worked had a limited circulation and was not very influential. But
      Vladimir Semyonitch believed that sooner or later he would succeed in
      getting on to a solid magazine where he would have scope and could display
      himself&mdash;and what little distress he felt on this score was pale
      beside the brilliance of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visiting this charming man, I made the acquaintance of his sister, Vera
      Semyonovna, a woman doctor. At first sight, what struck me about this
      woman was her look of exhaustion and extreme ill-health. She was young,
      with a good figure and regular, rather large features, but in comparison
      with her agile, elegant, and talkative brother she seemed angular,
      listless, slovenly, and sullen. There was something strained, cold,
      apathetic in her movements, smiles, and words; she was not liked, and was
      thought proud and not very intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, I fancy, she was resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; her brother would often say to me, sighing and flinging
      back his hair in his picturesque literary way, &ldquo;one must never judge by
      appearances! Look at this book: it has long ago been read. It is warped,
      tattered, and lies in the dust uncared for; but open it, and it will make
      you weep and turn pale. My sister is like that book. Lift the cover and
      peep into her soul, and you will be horror-stricken. Vera passed in some
      three months through experiences that would have been ample for a whole
      lifetime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vladimir Semyonitch looked round him, took me by the sleeve, and began to
      whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, after taking her degree she married, for love, an architect.
      It&rsquo;s a complete tragedy! They had hardly been married a month when&mdash;whew&mdash;her
      husband died of typhus. But that was not all. She caught typhus from him,
      and when, on her recovery, she learnt that her Ivan was dead, she took a
      good dose of morphia. If it had not been for vigorous measures taken by
      her friends, my Vera would have been by now in Paradise. Tell me, isn&rsquo;t it
      a tragedy? And is not my sister like an <i>ingénue</i>, who has played
      already all the five acts of her life? The audience may stay for the
      farce, but the <i>ingénue</i> must go home to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After three months of misery Vera Semyonovna had come to live with her
      brother. She was not fitted for the practice of medicine, which exhausted
      her and did not satisfy her; she did not give one the impression of
      knowing her subject, and I never once heard her say anything referring to
      her medical studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave up medicine, and, silent and unoccupied, as though she were a
      prisoner, spent the remainder of her youth in colourless apathy, with
      bowed head and hanging hands. The only thing to which she was not
      completely indifferent, and which brought some brightness into the
      twilight of her life, was the presence of her brother, whom she loved. She
      loved him himself and his programme, she was full of reverence for his
      articles; and when she was asked what her brother was doing, she would
      answer in a subdued voice as though afraid of waking or distracting him:
      &ldquo;He is writing. . . .&rdquo; Usually when he was at his work she used to sit
      beside him, her eyes fixed on his writing hand. She used at such moments
      to look like a sick animal warming itself in the sun. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting at his table writing a
      critical article for his newspaper: Vera Semyonovna was sitting beside
      him, staring as usual at his writing hand. The critic wrote rapidly,
      without erasures or corrections. The pen scratched and squeaked. On the
      table near the writing hand there lay open a freshly-cut volume of a thick
      magazine, containing a story of peasant life, signed with two initials.
      Vladimir Semyonitch was enthusiastic; he thought the author was admirable
      in his handling of the subject, suggested Turgenev in his descriptions of
      nature, was truthful, and had an excellent knowledge of the life of the
      peasantry. The critic himself knew nothing of peasant life except from
      books and hearsay, but his feelings and his inner convictions forced him
      to believe the story. He foretold a brilliant future for the author,
      assured him he should await the conclusion of the story with great
      impatience, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine story!&rdquo; he said, flinging himself back in his chair and closing his
      eyes with pleasure. &ldquo;The tone is extremely good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera Semyonovna looked at him, yawned aloud, and suddenly asked an
      unexpected question. In the evening she had a habit of yawning nervously
      and asking short, abrupt questions, not always relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Volodya,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what is the meaning of non-resistance to evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non-resistance to evil!&rdquo; repeated her brother, opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What do you understand by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear, imagine that thieves or brigands attack you, and you,
      instead of . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, give me a logical definition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A logical definition? Um! Well.&rdquo; Vladimir Semyonitch pondered.
      &ldquo;Non-resistance to evil means an attitude of non-interference with regard
      to all that in the sphere of mortality is called evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Vladimir Semyonitch bent over the table and took up a novel.
      This novel, written by a woman, dealt with the painfulness of the
      irregular position of a society lady who was living under the same roof
      with her lover and her illegitimate child. Vladimir Semyonitch was pleased
      with the excellent tendency of the story, the plot and the presentation of
      it. Making a brief summary of the novel, he selected the best passages and
      added to them in his account: &ldquo;How true to reality, how living, how
      picturesque! The author is not merely an artist; he is also a subtle
      psychologist who can see into the hearts of his characters. Take, for
      example, this vivid description of the emotions of the heroine on meeting
      her husband,&rdquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Volodya,&rdquo; Vera Semyonovna interrupted his critical effusions, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      haunted by a strange idea since yesterday. I keep wondering where we
      should all be if human life were ordered on the basis of non-resistance to
      evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all probability, nowhere. Non-resistance to evil would give the full
      rein to the criminal will, and, to say nothing of civilisation, this would
      leave not one stone standing upon another anywhere on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bashi-Bazouke and brothels. In my next article I&rsquo;ll talk about that
      perhaps. Thank you for reminding me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a week later my friend kept his promise. That was just at the period&mdash;in
      the eighties&mdash;when people were beginning to talk and write of
      non-resistance, of the right to judge, to punish, to make war; when some
      people in our set were beginning to do without servants, to retire into
      the country, to work on the land, and to renounce animal food and carnal
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading her brother&rsquo;s article, Vera Semyonovna pondered and hardly
      perceptibly shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But still there&rsquo;s a great deal I don&rsquo;t understand.
      For instance, in Leskov&rsquo;s story &lsquo;Belonging to the Cathedral&rsquo; there is a
      queer gardener who sows for the benefit of all&mdash;for customers, for
      beggars, and any who care to steal. Did he behave sensibly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From his sister&rsquo;s tone and expression Vladimir Semyonitch saw that she did
      not like his article, and, almost for the first time in his life, his
      vanity as an author sustained a shock. With a shade of irritation he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theft is immoral. To sow for thieves is to recognise the right of thieves
      to existence. What would you think if I were to establish a newspaper and,
      dividing it into sections, provide for blackmailing as well as for liberal
      ideas? Following the example of that gardener, I ought, logically, to
      provide a section for blackmailers, the intellectual scoundrels? Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera Semyonovna made no answer. She got up from the table, moved languidly
      to the sofa and lay down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I know nothing about it,&rdquo; she said musingly. &ldquo;You are
      probably right, but it seems to me, I feel somehow, that there&rsquo;s something
      false in our resistance to evil, as though there were something concealed
      or unsaid. God knows, perhaps our methods of resisting evil belong to the
      category of prejudices which have become so deeply rooted in us, that we
      are incapable of parting with them, and therefore cannot form a correct
      judgment of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain to you. Perhaps man is mistaken in thinking
      that he is obliged to resist evil and has a right to do so, just as he is
      mistaken in thinking, for instance, that the heart looks like an ace of
      hearts. It is very possible in resisting evil we ought not to use force,
      but to use what is the very opposite of force&mdash;if you, for instance,
      don&rsquo;t want this picture stolen from you, you ought to give it away rather
      than lock it up. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s clever, very clever! If I want to marry a rich, vulgar woman, she
      ought to prevent me from such a shabby action by hastening to make me an
      offer herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother and sister talked till midnight without understanding each
      other. If any outsider had overheard them he would hardly have been able
      to make out what either of them was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      They usually spent the evening at home. There were no friends&rsquo; houses to
      which they could go, and they felt no need for friends; they only went to
      the theatre when there was a new play&mdash;such was the custom in
      literary circles&mdash;they did not go to concerts, for they did not care
      for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think what you like,&rdquo; Vera Semyonovna began again the next day,
      &ldquo;but for me the question is to a great extent settled. I am firmly
      convinced that I have no grounds for resisting evil directed against me
      personally. If they want to kill me, let them. My defending myself will
      not make the murderer better. All I have now to decide is the second half
      of the question: how I ought to behave to evil directed against my
      neighbours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vera, mind you don&rsquo;t become rabid!&rdquo; said Vladimir Semyonitch, laughing.
      &ldquo;I see non-resistance is becoming your <i>idée fixe</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to turn off these tedious conversations with a jest, but somehow
      it was beyond a jest; his smile was artificial and sour. His sister gave
      up sitting beside his table and gazing reverently at his writing hand, and
      he felt every evening that behind him on the sofa lay a person who did not
      agree with him. And his back grew stiff and numb, and there was a chill in
      his soul. An author&rsquo;s vanity is vindictive, implacable, incapable of
      forgiveness, and his sister was the first and only person who had laid
      bare and disturbed that uneasy feeling, which is like a big box of
      crockery, easy to unpack but impossible to pack up again as it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks and months passed by, and his sister clung to her ideas, and did not
      sit down by the table. One spring evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting
      at his table writing an article. He was reviewing a novel which described
      how a village schoolmistress refused the man whom she loved and who loved
      her, a man both wealthy and intellectual, simply because marriage made her
      work as a schoolmistress impossible. Vera Semyonovna lay on the sofa and
      brooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, how slow it is!&rdquo; she said, stretching. &ldquo;How insipid and empty
      life is! I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself, and you are wasting your
      best years in goodness knows what. Like some alchemist, you are rummaging
      in old rubbish that nobody wants. My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vladimir Semyonitch dropped his pen and slowly looked round at his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s depressing to look at you!&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;Wagner in &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; dug
      up worms, but he was looking for a treasure, anyway, and you are looking
      for worms for the sake of the worms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s vague!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Volodya; all these days I&rsquo;ve been thinking, I&rsquo;ve been thinking
      painfully for a long time, and I have come to the conclusion that you are
      hopelessly reactionary and conventional. Come, ask yourself what is the
      object of your zealous, conscientious work? Tell me, what is it? Why,
      everything has long ago been extracted that can be extracted from that
      rubbish in which you are always rummaging. You may pound water in a mortar
      and analyse it as long as you like, you&rsquo;ll make nothing more of it than
      the chemists have made already. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; drawled Vladimir Semyonitch, getting up. &ldquo;Yes, all this is old
      rubbish because these ideas are eternal; but what do you consider new,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You undertake to work in the domain of thought; it is for you to think of
      something new. It&rsquo;s not for me to teach you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;an alchemist!&rdquo; the critic cried in wonder and indignation,
      screwing up his eyes ironically. &ldquo;Art, progress&mdash;all that is
      alchemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Volodya, it seems to me that if all you thinking people had set
      yourselves to solving great problems, all these little questions that you
      fuss about now would solve themselves by the way. If you go up in a
      balloon to see a town, you will incidentally, without any effort, see the
      fields and the villages and the rivers as well. When stearine is
      manufactured, you get glycerine as a by-product. It seems to me that
      contemporary thought has settled on one spot and stuck to it. It is
      prejudiced, apathetic, timid, afraid to take a wide titanic flight, just
      as you and I are afraid to climb on a high mountain; it is conservative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such conversations could not but leave traces. The relations of the
      brother and sister grew more and more strained every day. The brother
      became unable to work in his sister&rsquo;s presence, and grew irritable when he
      knew his sister was lying on the sofa, looking at his back; while the
      sister frowned nervously and stretched when, trying to bring back the
      past, he attempted to share his enthusiasms with her. Every evening she
      complained of being bored, and talked about independence of mind and those
      who are in the rut of tradition. Carried away by her new ideas, Vera
      Semyonovna proved that the work that her brother was so engrossed in was
      conventional, that it was a vain effort of conservative minds to preserve
      what had already served its turn and was vanishing from the scene of
      action. She made no end of comparisons. She compared her brother at one
      time to an alchemist, then to a musty old Believer who would sooner die
      than listen to reason. By degrees there was a perceptible change in her
      manner of life, too. She was capable of lying on the sofa all day long
      doing nothing but think, while her face wore a cold, dry expression such
      as one sees in one-sided people of strong faith. She began to refuse the
      attentions of the servants, swept and tidied her own room, cleaned her own
      boots and brushed her own clothes. Her brother could not help looking with
      irritation and even hatred at her cold face when she went about her menial
      work. In that work, which was always performed with a certain solemnity,
      he saw something strained and false, he saw something both pharisaical and
      affected. And knowing he could not touch her by persuasion, he carped at
      her and teased her like a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t resist evil, but you resist my having servants!&rdquo; he taunted
      her. &ldquo;If servants are an evil, why do you oppose it? That&rsquo;s inconsistent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suffered, was indignant and even ashamed. He felt ashamed when his
      sister began doing odd things before strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said to me in private, waving his hands
      in despair. &ldquo;It seems that our <i>ingénue</i> has remained to play a part
      in the farce, too. She&rsquo;s become morbid to the marrow of her bones! I&rsquo;ve
      washed my hands of her, let her think as she likes; but why does she talk,
      why does she excite me? She ought to think what it means for me to listen
      to her. What I feel when in my presence she has the effrontery to support
      her errors by blasphemously quoting the teaching of Christ! It chokes me!
      It makes me hot all over to hear my sister propounding her doctrines and
      trying to distort the Gospel to suit her, when she purposely refrains from
      mentioning how the moneychangers were driven out of the Temple. That&rsquo;s, my
      dear fellow, what comes of being half educated, undeveloped! That&rsquo;s what
      comes of medical studies which provide no general culture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day on coming home from the office, Vladimir Semyonitch found his
      sister crying. She was sitting on the sofa with her head bowed, wringing
      her hands, and tears were flowing freely down her cheeks. The critic&rsquo;s
      good heart throbbed with pain. Tears fell from his eyes, too, and he
      longed to pet his sister, to forgive her, to beg her forgiveness, and to
      live as they used to before. . . . He knelt down and kissed her head, her
      hands, her shoulders. . . . She smiled, smiled bitterly, unaccountably,
      while he with a cry of joy jumped up, seized the magazine from the table
      and said warmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;ll live as we used to, Verotchka! With God&rsquo;s blessing! And
      I&rsquo;ve such a surprise for you here! Instead of celebrating the occasion
      with champagne, let us read it together! A splendid, wonderful thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; cried Vera Semyonovna, pushing away the book in alarm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      read it already! I don&rsquo;t want it, I don&rsquo;t want it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year . . . two years ago. . . I read it long ago, and I know it, I know
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . . You&rsquo;re a fanatic!&rdquo; her brother said coldly, flinging the
      magazine on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are a fanatic, not I! You!&rdquo; And Vera Semyonovna dissolved into
      tears again. Her brother stood before her, looked at her quivering
      shoulders, and thought. He thought, not of the agonies of loneliness
      endured by any one who begins to think in a new way of their own, not of
      the inevitable sufferings of a genuine spiritual revolution, but of the
      outrage of his programme, the outrage to his author&rsquo;s vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time he treated his sister coldly, with careless irony, and he
      endured her presence in the room as one endures the presence of old women
      that are dependent on one. For her part, she left off disputing with him
      and met all his arguments, jeers, and attacks with a condescending silence
      which irritated him more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer morning Vera Semyonovna, dressed for travelling with a satchel
      over her shoulder, went in to her brother and coldly kissed him on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the province of N. to do vaccination work.&rdquo; Her brother went out into
      the street with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve decided upon, you queer girl,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you want some money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sister shook her brother&rsquo;s hand and set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have a cab?&rdquo; cried Vladimir Semyonitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. Her brother gazed after her, watched her rusty-looking
      waterproof, the swaying of her figure as she slouched along, forced
      himself to sigh, but did not succeed in rousing a feeling of regret. His
      sister had become a stranger to him. And he was a stranger to her. Anyway,
      she did not once look round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to his room, Vladimir Semyonitch at once sat down to the table
      and began to work at his article.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw Vera Semyonovna again. Where she is now I do not know. And
      Vladimir Semyonitch went on writing his articles, laying wreaths on
      coffins, singing <i>Gaudeamus</i>, busying himself over the Mutual Aid
      Society of Moscow Journalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell ill with inflammation of the lungs; he was ill in bed for three
      months&mdash;at first at home, and afterwards in the Golitsyn Hospital. An
      abscess developed in his knee. People said he ought to be sent to the
      Crimea, and began getting up a collection for him. But he did not go to
      the Crimea&mdash;he died. We buried him in the Vagankovsky Cemetery, on
      the left side, where artists and literary men are buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we writers were sitting in the Tatars&rsquo; restaurant. I mentioned
      that I had lately been in the Vagankovsky Cemetery and had seen Vladimir
      Semyonitch&rsquo;s grave there. It was utterly neglected and almost
      indistinguishable from the rest of the ground, the cross had fallen; it
      was necessary to collect a few roubles to put it in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they listened to what I said unconcernedly, made no answer, and I
      could not collect a farthing. No one remembered Vladimir Semyonitch. He
      was utterly forgotten.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>RACEFULLY swaying
      in the saddle, a young man wearing the snow-white tunic of an officer rode
      into the great yard of the vodka distillery belonging to the heirs of M.
      E. Rothstein. The sun smiled carelessly on the lieutenant&rsquo;s little stars,
      on the white trunks of the birch-trees, on the heaps of broken glass
      scattered here and there in the yard. The radiant, vigorous beauty of a
      summer day lay over everything, and nothing hindered the snappy young
      green leaves from dancing gaily and winking at the clear blue sky. Even
      the dirty and soot-begrimed appearance of the bricksheds and the stifling
      fumes of the distillery did not spoil the general good impression. The
      lieutenant sprang gaily out of the saddle, handed over his horse to a man
      who ran up, and stroking with his finger his delicate black moustaches,
      went in at the front door. On the top step of the old but light and softly
      carpeted staircase he was met by a maidservant with a haughty, not very
      youthful face. The lieutenant gave her his card without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went through the rooms with the card, the maid could see on it the
      name &ldquo;Alexandr Grigoryevitch Sokolsky.&rdquo; A minute later she came back and
      told the lieutenant that her mistress could not see him, as she was not
      feeling quite well. Sokolsky looked at the ceiling and thrust out his
      lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How vexatious!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Listen, my dear,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;Go and tell
      Susanna Moiseyevna, that it is very necessary for me to speak to her&mdash;very.
      I will only keep her one minute. Ask her to excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid shrugged one shoulder and went off languidly to her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; she sighed, returning after a brief interval. &ldquo;Please walk
      in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant went with her through five or six large, luxuriously
      furnished rooms and a corridor, and finally found himself in a large and
      lofty square room, in which from the first step he was impressed by the
      abundance of flowers and plants and the sweet, almost revoltingly heavy
      fragrance of jasmine. Flowers were trained to trellis-work along the
      walls, screening the windows, hung from the ceiling, and were wreathed
      over the corners, so that the room was more like a greenhouse than a place
      to live in. Tits, canaries, and goldfinches chirruped among the green
      leaves and fluttered against the window-panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for receiving you here,&rdquo; the lieutenant heard in a mellow
      feminine voice with a burr on the letter <i>r</i> which was not without
      charm. &ldquo;Yesterday I had a sick headache, and I&rsquo;m trying to keep still to
      prevent its coming on again. What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exactly opposite the entrance, he saw sitting in a big low chair, such as
      old men use, a woman in an expensive Chinese dressing-gown, with her head
      wrapped up, leaning back on a pillow. Nothing could be seen behind the
      woollen shawl in which she was muffled but a pale, long, pointed, somewhat
      aquiline nose, and one large dark eye. Her ample dressing-gown concealed
      her figure, but judging from her beautiful hand, from her voice, her nose,
      and her eye, she might be twenty-six or twenty-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for being so persistent . . .&rdquo; began the lieutenant, clinking
      his spurs. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce myself: Sokolsky! I come with a message
      from my cousin, your neighbour, Alexey Ivanovitch Kryukov, who . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; interposed Susanna Moiseyevna. &ldquo;I know Kryukov. Sit down; I
      don&rsquo;t like anything big standing before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin charges me to ask you a favour,&rdquo; the lieutenant went on,
      clinking his spurs once more and sitting down. &ldquo;The fact is, your late
      father made a purchase of oats from my cousin last winter, and a small sum
      was left owing. The payment only becomes due next week, but my cousin begs
      you most particularly to pay him&mdash;if possible, to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the lieutenant talked, he stole side-glances about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;m not in her bedroom?&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner of the room, where the foliage was thickest and tallest,
      under a pink awning like a funeral canopy, stood a bed not yet made, with
      the bedclothes still in disorder. Close by on two arm-chairs lay heaps of
      crumpled feminine garments. Petticoats and sleeves with rumpled lace and
      flounces were trailing on the carpet, on which here and there lay bits of
      white tape, cigarette-ends, and the papers of caramels. . . . Under the
      bed the toes, pointed and square, of slippers of all kinds peeped out in a
      long row. And it seemed to the lieutenant that the scent of the jasmine
      came not from the flowers, but from the bed and the slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the sum owing?&rdquo; asked Susanna Moiseyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand three hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the Jewess, showing another large black eye. &ldquo;And you call
      that&mdash;a small sum! However, it&rsquo;s just the same paying it to-day or
      paying it in a week, but I&rsquo;ve had so many payments to make in the last two
      months since my father&rsquo;s death. . . . Such a lot of stupid business, it
      makes my head go round! A nice idea! I want to go abroad, and they keep
      forcing me to attend to these silly things. Vodka, oats . . .&rdquo; she
      muttered, half closing her eyes, &ldquo;oats, bills, percentages, or, as my
      head-clerk says, &lsquo;percentage.&rsquo; . . . It&rsquo;s awful. Yesterday I simply turned
      the excise officer out. He pesters me with his Tralles. I said to him: &lsquo;Go
      to the devil with your Tralles! I can&rsquo;t see any one!&rsquo; He kissed my hand
      and went away. I tell you what: can&rsquo;t your cousin wait two or three
      months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cruel question!&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant. &ldquo;My cousin can wait a year,
      but it&rsquo;s I who cannot wait! You see, it&rsquo;s on my own account I&rsquo;m acting, I
      ought to tell you. At all costs I must have money, and by ill-luck my
      cousin hasn&rsquo;t a rouble to spare. I&rsquo;m forced to ride about and collect
      debts. I&rsquo;ve just been to see a peasant, our tenant; here I&rsquo;m now calling
      on you; from here I shall go on to somewhere else, and keep on like that
      until I get together five thousand roubles. I need money awfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! What does a young man want with money? Whims, mischief. Why,
      have you been going in for dissipation? Or losing at cards? Or are you
      getting married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed!&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant, and rising slightly from his
      seat, he clinked his spurs. &ldquo;I really am going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susanna Moiseyevna looked intently at her visitor, made a wry face, and
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out what possesses people to get married!&rdquo; she said, looking
      about her for her pocket-handkerchief. &ldquo;Life is so short, one has so
      little freedom, and they must put chains on themselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one has his own way of looking at things. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course; every one has his own way of looking at things . . .
      . But, I say, are you really going to marry some one poor? Are you
      passionately in love? And why must you have five thousand? Why won&rsquo;t four
      do, or three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a tongue she has!&rdquo; thought the lieutenant, and answered: &ldquo;The
      difficulty is that an officer is not allowed by law to marry till he is
      twenty-eight; if you choose to marry, you have to leave the Service or
      else pay a deposit of five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I understand. Listen. You said just now that every one has his
      own way of looking at things. . . . Perhaps your fiancée is some one
      special and remarkable, but . . . but I am utterly unable to understand
      how any decent man can live with a woman. I can&rsquo;t for the life of me
      understand it. I have lived, thank the Lord, twenty-seven years, and I
      have never yet seen an endurable woman. They&rsquo;re all affected minxes,
      immoral, liars. . . . The only ones I can put up with are cooks and
      housemaids, but so-called ladies I won&rsquo;t let come within shooting distance
      of me. But, thank God, they hate me and don&rsquo;t force themselves on me! If
      one of them wants money she sends her husband, but nothing will induce her
      to come herself, not from pride&mdash;no, but from cowardice; she&rsquo;s afraid
      of my making a scene. Oh, I understand their hatred very well! Rather! I
      openly display what they do their very utmost to conceal from God and man.
      How can they help hating me? No doubt you&rsquo;ve heard bushels of scandal
      about me already. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only arrived here so lately . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut! . . . I see from your eyes! But your brother&rsquo;s wife,
      surely she primed you for this expedition? Think of letting a young man
      come to see such an awful woman without warning him&mdash;how could she?
      Ha, ha! . . . But tell me, how is your brother? He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, such a
      handsome man! . . . I&rsquo;ve seen him several times at mass. Why do you look
      at me like that? I very often go to church! We all have the same God. To
      an educated person externals matter less than the idea. . . . That&rsquo;s so,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course . . .&rdquo; smiled the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the idea. . . . But you are not a bit like your brother. You are
      handsome, too, but your brother is a great deal better-looking. There&rsquo;s
      wonderfully little likeness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite natural; he&rsquo;s not my brother, but my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure! So you must have the money to-day? Why to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My furlough is over in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done with you!&rdquo; sighed Susanna Moiseyevna. &ldquo;So be it.
      I&rsquo;ll give you the money, though I know you&rsquo;ll abuse me for it afterwards.
      You&rsquo;ll quarrel with your wife after you are married, and say: &lsquo;If that
      mangy Jewess hadn&rsquo;t given me the money, I should perhaps have been as free
      as a bird to-day!&rsquo; Is your fiancée pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . . Anyway, better something, if it&rsquo;s only beauty, than nothing.
      Though however beautiful a woman is, it can never make up to her husband
      for her silliness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s original!&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant. &ldquo;You are a woman yourself, and
      such a woman-hater!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman . . .&rdquo; smiled Susanna. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault that God has cast me
      into this mould, is it? I&rsquo;m no more to blame for it than you are for
      having moustaches. The violin is not responsible for the choice of its
      case. I am very fond of myself, but when any one reminds me that I am a
      woman, I begin to hate myself. Well, you can go away, and I&rsquo;ll dress. Wait
      for me in the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant went out, and the first thing he did was to draw a deep
      breath, to get rid of the heavy scent of jasmine, which had begun to
      irritate his throat and to make him feel giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange woman!&rdquo; he thought, looking about him. &ldquo;She talks
      fluently, but . . . far too much, and too freely. She must be neurotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room, in which he was standing now, was richly furnished, and
      had pretensions to luxury and style. There were dark bronze dishes with
      patterns in relief, views of Nice and the Rhine on the tables,
      old-fashioned sconces, Japanese statuettes, but all this striving after
      luxury and style only emphasised the lack of taste which was glaringly
      apparent in the gilt cornices, the gaudy wall-paper, the bright velvet
      table-cloths, the common oleographs in heavy frames. The bad taste of the
      general effect was the more complete from the lack of finish and the
      overcrowding of the room, which gave one a feeling that something was
      lacking, and that a great deal should have been thrown away. It was
      evident that the furniture had not been bought all at once, but had been
      picked up at auctions and other favourable opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows what taste the lieutenant could boast of, but even he noticed
      one characteristic peculiarity about the whole place, which no luxury or
      style could efface&mdash;a complete absence of all trace of womanly,
      careful hands, which, as we all know, give a warmth, poetry, and snugness
      to the furnishing of a room. There was a chilliness about it such as one
      finds in waiting-rooms at stations, in clubs, and foyers at the theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely anything in the room definitely Jewish, except,
      perhaps, a big picture of the meeting of Jacob and Esau. The lieutenant
      looked round about him, and, shrugging his shoulders, thought of his
      strange, new acquaintance, of her free-and-easy manners, and her way of
      talking. But then the door opened, and in the doorway appeared the lady
      herself, in a long black dress, so slim and tightly laced that her figure
      looked as though it had been turned in a lathe. Now the lieutenant saw not
      only the nose and eyes, but also a thin white face, a head black and as
      curly as lamb&rsquo;s-wool. She did not attract him, though she did not strike
      him as ugly. He had a prejudice against un-Russian faces in general, and
      he considered, too, that the lady&rsquo;s white face, the whiteness of which for
      some reason suggested the cloying scent of jasmine, did not go well with
      her little black curls and thick eyebrows; that her nose and ears were
      astoundingly white, as though they belonged to a corpse, or had been
      moulded out of transparent wax. When she smiled she showed pale gums as
      well as her teeth, and he did not like that either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anæmic debility . . .&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s probably as nervous as a
      turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am! Come along!&rdquo; she said, going on rapidly ahead of him and
      pulling off the yellow leaves from the plants as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the money directly, and if you like I&rsquo;ll give you some
      lunch. Two thousand three hundred roubles! After such a good stroke of
      business you&rsquo;ll have an appetite for your lunch. Do you like my rooms? The
      ladies about here declare that my rooms always smell of garlic. With that
      culinary gibe their stock of wit is exhausted. I hasten to assure you that
      I&rsquo;ve no garlic even in the cellar. And one day when a doctor came to see
      me who smelt of garlic, I asked him to take his hat and go and spread his
      fragrance elsewhere. There is no smell of garlic here, but the place does
      smell of drugs. My father lay paralyzed for a year and a half, and the
      whole house smelt of medicine. A year and a half! I was sorry to lose him,
      but I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s dead: he suffered so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the officer through two rooms similar to the drawing-room, through
      a large reception hall, and came to a stop in her study, where there was a
      lady&rsquo;s writing-table covered with little knick-knacks. On the carpet near
      it several books lay strewn about, opened and folded back. Through a small
      door leading from the study he saw a table laid for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still chatting, Susanna took out of her pocket a bunch of little keys and
      unlocked an ingeniously made cupboard with a curved, sloping lid. When the
      lid was raised the cupboard emitted a plaintive note which made the
      lieutenant think of an Æolian harp. Susanna picked out another key and
      clicked another lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have underground passages here and secret doors,&rdquo; she said, taking out
      a small morocco portfolio. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny cupboard, isn&rsquo;t it? And in this
      portfolio I have a quarter of my fortune. Look how podgy it is! You won&rsquo;t
      strangle me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susanna raised her eyes to the lieutenant and laughed good-naturedly. The
      lieutenant laughed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather jolly,&rdquo; he thought, watching the keys flashing between her
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said, picking out the key of the portfolio. &ldquo;Now, Mr.
      Creditor, trot out the IOU. What a silly thing money is really! How paltry
      it is, and yet how women love it! I am a Jewess, you know, to the marrow
      of my bones. I am passionately fond of Shmuls and Yankels, but how I
      loathe that passion for gain in our Semitic blood. They hoard and they
      don&rsquo;t know what they are hoarding for. One ought to live and enjoy
      oneself, but they&rsquo;re afraid of spending an extra farthing. In that way I
      am more like an hussar than a Shmul. I don&rsquo;t like money to be kept long in
      one place. And altogether I fancy I&rsquo;m not much like a Jewess. Does my
      accent give me away much, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo; mumbled the lieutenant. &ldquo;You speak good Russian, but
      you do roll your <i>r&rsquo;s</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susanna laughed and put the little key in the lock of the portfolio. The
      lieutenant took out of his pocket a little roll of IOUs and laid them with
      a notebook on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing betrays a Jew as much as his accent,&rdquo; Susanna went on, looking
      gaily at the lieutenant. &ldquo;However much he twists himself into a Russian or
      a Frenchman, ask him to say &lsquo;feather&rsquo; and he will say &lsquo;fedder&rsquo; . . . but I
      pronounce it correctly: &lsquo;Feather! feather! feather!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, she&rsquo;s very jolly!&rdquo; thought Sokolsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susanna put the portfolio on a chair, took a step towards the lieutenant,
      and bringing her face close to his, went on gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next to the Jews I love no people so much as the Russian and the French.
      I did not do much at school and I know no history, but it seems to me that
      the fate of the world lies in the hands of those two nations. I lived a
      long time abroad. . . . I spent six months in Madrid. . . . I&rsquo;ve gazed my
      fill at the public, and the conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to is that there are no
      decent peoples except the Russian and the French. Take the languages, for
      instance. . . . The German language is like the neighing of horses; as for
      the English . . . you can&rsquo;t imagine anything stupider. Fight&mdash;feet&mdash;foot!
      Italian is only pleasant when they speak it slowly. If you listen to
      Italians gabbling, you get the effect of the Jewish jargon. And the Poles?
      Mercy on us! There&rsquo;s no language so disgusting! &lsquo;Nie pieprz, Pietrze,
      pieprzem wieprza bo mozeoz przepieprzyé wieprza pieprzem.&rsquo; That means:
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t pepper a sucking pig with pepper, Pyotr, or perhaps you&rsquo;ll
      over-pepper the sucking pig with pepper.&rsquo; Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susanna Moiseyevna rolled her eyes and broke into such a pleasant,
      infectious laugh that the lieutenant, looking at her, went off into a loud
      and merry peal of laughter. She took the visitor by the button, and went
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Jews, of course . . . they&rsquo;ve many faults, like all
      nations. I don&rsquo;t dispute that. But are the Jews to blame for it? No, it&rsquo;s
      not the Jews who are to blame, but the Jewish women! They are
      narrow-minded, greedy; there&rsquo;s no sort of poetry about them, they&rsquo;re dull.
      . . . You have never lived with a Jewess, so you don&rsquo;t know how charming
      it is!&rdquo; Susanna Moiseyevna pronounced the last words with deliberate
      emphasis and with no eagerness or laughter. She paused as though
      frightened at her own openness, and her face was suddenly distorted in a
      strange, unaccountable way. Her eyes stared at the lieutenant without
      blinking, her lips parted and showed clenched teeth. Her whole face, her
      throat, and even her bosom, seemed quivering with a spiteful, catlike
      expression. Still keeping her eyes fixed on her visitor, she rapidly bent
      to one side, and swiftly, like a cat, snatched something from the table.
      All this was the work of a few seconds. Watching her movements, the
      lieutenant saw five fingers crumple up his IOUs and caught a glimpse of
      the white rustling paper as it disappeared in her clenched fist. Such an
      extraordinary transition from good-natured laughter to crime so appalled
      him that he turned pale and stepped back. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, still keeping her frightened, searching eyes upon him, felt along
      her hip with her clenched fist for her pocket. Her fist struggled
      convulsively for the pocket, like a fish in the net, and could not find
      the opening. In another moment the IOUs would have vanished in the
      recesses of her feminine garments, but at that point the lieutenant
      uttered a faint cry, and, moved more by instinct than reflection, seized
      the Jewess by her arm above the clenched fist. Showing her teeth more than
      ever, she struggled with all her might and pulled her hand away. Then
      Sokolsky put his right arm firmly round her waist, and the other round her
      chest and a struggle followed. Afraid of outraging her sex or hurting her,
      he tried only to prevent her moving, and to get hold of the fist with the
      IOUs; but she wriggled like an eel in his arms with her supple, flexible
      body, struck him in the chest with her elbows, and scratched him, so that
      he could not help touching her all over, and was forced to hurt her and
      disregard her modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unusual this is! How strange!&rdquo; he thought, utterly amazed, hardly
      able to believe his senses, and feeling rather sick from the scent of
      jasmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence, breathing heavily, stumbling against the furniture, they moved
      about the room. Susanna was carried away by the struggle. She flushed,
      closed her eyes, and forgetting herself, once even pressed her face
      against the face of the lieutenant, so that there was a sweetish taste
      left on his lips. At last he caught hold of her clenched hand. . . .
      Forcing it open, and not finding the papers in it, he let go the Jewess.
      With flushed faces and dishevelled hair, they looked at one another,
      breathing hard. The spiteful, catlike expression on the Jewess&rsquo;s face was
      gradually replaced by a good-natured smile. She burst out laughing, and
      turning on one foot, went towards the room where lunch was ready. The
      lieutenant moved slowly after her. She sat down to the table, and, still
      flushed and breathing hard, tossed off half a glass of port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen&rdquo;&mdash;the lieutenant broke the silence&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you are
      joking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; she answered, thrusting a piece of bread into her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . . How do you wish me to take all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you choose. Sit down and have lunch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But . . . it&rsquo;s dishonest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But don&rsquo;t trouble to give me a sermon; I have my own way of
      looking at things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give them back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! If you were a poor unfortunate man, with nothing to eat,
      then it would be a different matter. But&mdash;he wants to get married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my money, you know; it&rsquo;s my cousin&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does your cousin want with money? To get fashionable clothes for
      his wife? But I really don&rsquo;t care whether your <i>belle-soeur</i> has
      dresses or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant had ceased to remember that he was in a strange house with
      an unknown lady, and did not trouble himself with decorum. He strode up
      and down the room, scowled and nervously fingered his waistcoat. The fact
      that the Jewess had lowered herself in his eyes by her dishonest action,
      made him feel bolder and more free-and-easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil knows what to make of it!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Listen. I shan&rsquo;t go
      away from here until I get the IOUs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so much the better,&rdquo; laughed Susanna. &ldquo;If you stay here for good, it
      will make it livelier for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excited by the struggle, the lieutenant looked at Susanna&rsquo;s laughing,
      insolent face, at her munching mouth, at her heaving bosom, and grew
      bolder and more audacious. Instead of thinking about the IOU he began for
      some reason recalling with a sort of relish his cousin&rsquo;s stories of the
      Jewess&rsquo;s romantic adventures, of her free way of life, and these
      reminiscences only provoked him to greater audacity. Impulsively he sat
      down beside the Jewess and thinking no more of the IOUs began to eat. . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have vodka or wine?&rdquo; Susanna asked with a laugh. &ldquo;So you will
      stay till you get the IOUs? Poor fellow! How many days and nights you will
      have to spend with me, waiting for those IOUs! Won&rsquo;t your fiancée have
      something to say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Five hours had passed. The lieutenant&rsquo;s cousin, Alexey Ivanovitch Kryukov
      was walking about the rooms of his country-house in his dressing-gown and
      slippers, and looking impatiently out of window. He was a tall, sturdy
      man, with a large black beard and a manly face; and as the Jewess had
      truly said, he was handsome, though he had reached the age when men are
      apt to grow too stout, puffy, and bald. By mind and temperament he was one
      of those natures in which the Russian intellectual classes are so rich:
      warm-hearted, good-natured, well-bred, having some knowledge of the arts
      and sciences, some faith, and the most chivalrous notions about honour,
      but indolent and lacking in depth. He was fond of good eating and
      drinking, was an ideal whist-player, was a connoisseur in women and
      horses, but in other things he was apathetic and sluggish as a seal, and
      to rouse him from his lethargy something extraordinary and quite revolting
      was needed, and then he would forget everything in the world and display
      intense activity; he would fume and talk of a duel, write a petition of
      seven pages to a Minister, gallop at breakneck speed about the district,
      call some one publicly &ldquo;a scoundrel,&rdquo; would go to law, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it our Sasha&rsquo;s not back yet?&rdquo; he kept asking his wife, glancing
      out of window. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s dinner-time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for the lieutenant till six o&rsquo;clock, they sat down to
      dinner. When supper-time came, however, Alexey Ivanovitch was listening to
      every footstep, to every sound of the door, and kept shrugging his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rascally dandy must have stayed on at the
      tenant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he went to bed after supper, Kryukov made up his mind that the
      lieutenant was being entertained at the tenant&rsquo;s, where after a festive
      evening he was staying the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandr Grigoryevitch only returned next morning. He looked extremely
      crumpled and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you alone . . .&rdquo; he said mysteriously to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the study. The lieutenant shut the door, and he paced for a
      long time up and down before he began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t know how
      to tell you about. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And blushing, faltering, not looking at his cousin, he told what had
      happened with the IOUs. Kryukov, standing with his feet wide apart and his
      head bent, listened and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the devil could I be joking? It&rsquo;s no joking matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; muttered Kryukov, turning crimson and flinging up
      his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s positively . . . immoral on your part. Before your very
      eyes a hussy is up to the devil knows what, a serious crime, plays a nasty
      trick, and you go and kiss her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand myself how it happened!&rdquo; whispered the lieutenant,
      blinking guiltily. &ldquo;Upon my honour, I don&rsquo;t understand it! It&rsquo;s the first
      time in my life I&rsquo;ve come across such a monster! It&rsquo;s not her beauty that
      does for you, not her mind, but that . . . you understand . . . insolence,
      cynicism. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolence, cynicism . . . it&rsquo;s unclean! If you&rsquo;ve such a longing for
      insolence and cynicism, you might have picked a sow out of the mire and
      have devoured her alive. It would have been cheaper, anyway! Instead of
      two thousand three hundred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do express yourself elegantly!&rdquo; said the lieutenant, frowning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      pay you back the two thousand three hundred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll pay it back, but it&rsquo;s not a question of money! Damn the
      money! What revolts me is your being such a limp rag . . . such filthy
      feebleness! And engaged! With a fiancée!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it . . .&rdquo; said the lieutenant, blushing. &ldquo;I loathe myself
      as it is. I should like to sink into the earth. It&rsquo;s sickening and
      vexatious that I shall have to bother my aunt for that five thousand. . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov continued for some time longer expressing his indignation and
      grumbling, then, as he grew calmer, he sat down on the sofa and began to
      jeer at his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young officers!&rdquo; he said with contemptuous irony. &ldquo;Nice bridegrooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he leapt up as though he had been stung, stamped his foot, and
      ran about the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to leave it like that!&rdquo; he said, shaking his fist. &ldquo;I
      will have those IOUs, I will! I&rsquo;ll give it her! One doesn&rsquo;t beat women,
      but I&rsquo;ll break every bone in her body. . . . I&rsquo;ll pound her to a jelly!
      I&rsquo;m not a lieutenant! You won&rsquo;t touch me with insolence or cynicism!
      No-o-o, damn her! Mishka!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;run and tell them to get the
      racing droshky out for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov dressed rapidly, and, without heeding the agitated lieutenant, got
      into the droshky, and with a wave of his hand resolutely raced off to
      Susanna Moiseyevna. For a long time the lieutenant gazed out of window at
      the clouds of dust that rolled after his cousin&rsquo;s droshky, stretched,
      yawned, and went to his own room. A quarter of an hour later he was sound
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock he was waked up and summoned to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice this is of Alexey!&rdquo; his cousin&rsquo;s wife greeted him in the
      dining-room. &ldquo;He keeps us waiting for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say he&rsquo;s not come back yet?&rdquo; yawned the lieutenant. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!
      . . . he&rsquo;s probably gone round to see the tenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Alexey Ivanovitch was not back by supper either. His wife and Sokolsky
      decided that he was playing cards at the tenant&rsquo;s and would most likely
      stay the night there. What had happened was not what they had supposed,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov returned next morning, and without greeting any one, without a
      word, dashed into his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; whispered the lieutenant, gazing at him round-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov waved his hand and gave a snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov flopped on the sofa, thrust his head in the pillow, and shook with
      suppressed laughter. A minute later he got up, and looking at the
      surprised lieutenant, with his eyes full of tears from laughing, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the door. Well . . . she <i>is</i> a fe-e-male, I beg to inform
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get the IOUs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov waved his hand and went off into a peal of laughter again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! she is a female!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;<i>Merci</i> for the acquaintance,
      my boy! She&rsquo;s a devil in petticoats. I arrived; I walked in like such an
      avenging Jove, you know, that I felt almost afraid of myself . . . . I
      frowned, I scowled, even clenched my fists to be more awe-inspiring. . . .
      &lsquo;Jokes don&rsquo;t pay with me, madam!&rsquo; said I, and more in that style. And I
      threatened her with the law and with the Governor. To begin with she burst
      into tears, said she&rsquo;d been joking with you, and even took me to the
      cupboard to give me the money. Then she began arguing that the future of
      Europe lies in the hands of the French, and the Russians, swore at women.
      . . . Like you, I listened, fascinated, ass that I was. . . . She kept
      singing the praises of my beauty, patted me on the arm near the shoulder,
      to see how strong I was, and . . . and as you see, I&rsquo;ve only just got away
      from her! Ha, ha! She&rsquo;s enthusiastic about you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice fellow!&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant. &ldquo;A married man! highly
      respected. . . . Well, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed? Disgusted? Joking apart though,
      old man, you&rsquo;ve got your Queen Tamara in your own neighbourhood. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my own neighbourhood! Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t find another such chameleon in
      the whole of Russia! I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in my life, though I
      know a good bit about women, too. I have known regular devils in my time,
      but I never met anything like this. It is, as you say, by insolence and
      cynicism she gets over you. What is so attractive in her is the diabolical
      suddenness, the quick transitions, the swift shifting hues. . . . Brrr!
      And the IOU&mdash; phew! Write it off for lost. We are both great sinners,
      we&rsquo;ll go halves in our sin. I shall put down to you not two thousand three
      hundred, but half of it. Mind, tell my wife I was at the tenant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov and the lieutenant buried their heads in the pillows, and broke
      into laughter; they raised their heads, glanced at one another, and again
      subsided into their pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged! A lieutenant!&rdquo; Kryukov jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; retorted Sokolsky. &ldquo;Highly respected! Father of a family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner they talked in veiled allusions, winked at one another, and, to
      the surprise of the others, were continually gushing with laughter into
      their dinner-napkins. After dinner, still in the best of spirits, they
      dressed up as Turks, and, running after one another with guns, played at
      soldiers with the children. In the evening they had a long argument. The
      lieutenant maintained that it was mean and contemptible to accept a dowry
      with your wife, even when there was passionate love on both sides. Kryukov
      thumped the table with his fists and declared that this was absurd, and
      that a husband who did not like his wife to have property of her own was
      an egoist and a despot. Both shouted, boiled over, did not understand each
      other, drank a good deal, and in the end, picking up the skirts of their
      dressing-gowns, went to their bedrooms. They soon fell asleep and slept
      soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life went on as before, even, sluggish and free from sorrow. The shadows
      lay on the earth, thunder pealed from the clouds, from time to time the
      wind moaned plaintively, as though to prove that nature, too, could
      lament, but nothing troubled the habitual tranquillity of these people. Of
      Susanna Moiseyevna and the IOUs they said nothing. Both of them felt,
      somehow, ashamed to speak of the incident aloud. Yet they remembered it
      and thought of it with pleasure, as of a curious farce, which life had
      unexpectedly and casually played upon them, and which it would be pleasant
      to recall in old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth or seventh day after his visit to the Jewess, Kryukov was
      sitting in his study in the morning writing a congratulatory letter to his
      aunt. Alexandr Grigoryevitch was walking to and fro near the table in
      silence. The lieutenant had slept badly that night; he woke up depressed,
      and now he felt bored. He paced up and down, thinking of the end of his
      furlough, of his fiancée, who was expecting him, of how people could live
      all their lives in the country without feeling bored. Standing at the
      window, for a long time he stared at the trees, smoked three cigarettes
      one after another, and suddenly turned to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a favour to ask you, Alyosha,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me have a
      saddle-horse for the day. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov looked searchingly at him and continued his writing with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, then?&rdquo; asked the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kryukov looked at him again, then deliberately drew out a drawer in the
      table, and taking out a thick roll of notes, gave it to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s five thousand . . .&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Though it&rsquo;s not my money, yet, God
      bless you, it&rsquo;s all the same. I advise you to send for post-horses at once
      and go away. Yes, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant in his turn looked searchingly at Kryukov and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed right, Alyosha,&rdquo; he said, reddening. &ldquo;It was to her I
      meant to ride. Yesterday evening when the washerwoman gave me that damned
      tunic, the one I was wearing then, and it smelt of jasmine, why . . . I
      felt I must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly. And my furlough&rsquo;s just over. I really will go to-day!
      Yes, by Jove! However long one stays, one has to go in the end. . . . I&rsquo;m
      going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The post-horses were brought after dinner the same day; the lieutenant
      said good-bye to the Kryukovs and set off, followed by their good wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another week passed. It was a dull but hot and heavy day. From early
      morning Kryukov walked aimlessly about the house, looking out of window,
      or turning over the leaves of albums, though he was sick of the sight of
      them already. When he came across his wife or children, he began grumbling
      crossly. It seemed to him, for some reason that day, that his children&rsquo;s
      manners were revolting, that his wife did not know how to look after the
      servants, that their expenditure was quite disproportionate to their
      income. All this meant that &ldquo;the master&rdquo; was out of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Kryukov, feeling dissatisfied with the soup and the roast
      meat he had eaten, ordered out his racing droshky. He drove slowly out of
      the courtyard, drove at a walking pace for a quarter of a mile, and
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I . . . drive to her . . . that devil?&rdquo; he thought, looking at the
      leaden sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kryukov positively laughed, as though it were the first time that day
      he had asked himself that question. At once the load of boredom was lifted
      from his heart, and there rose a gleam of pleasure in his lazy eyes. He
      lashed the horse. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way his imagination was picturing how surprised the Jewess would
      be to see him, how he would laugh and chat, and come home feeling
      refreshed. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once a month one needs something to brighten one up . . . something out
      of the common round,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;something that would give the stagnant
      organism a good shaking up, a reaction . . . whether it&rsquo;s a drinking bout,
      or . . . Susanna. One can&rsquo;t get on without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was getting dark when he drove into the yard of the vodka distillery.
      From the open windows of the owner&rsquo;s house came sounds of laughter and
      singing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Brighter than lightning, more burning than flame. . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      sang a powerful, mellow, bass voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! she has visitors,&rdquo; thought Kryukov.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was annoyed that she had visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go back?&rdquo; he thought with his hand on the bell, but he rang all
      the same, and went up the familiar staircase. From the entry he glanced
      into the reception hall. There were about five men there&mdash;all
      landowners and officials of his acquaintance; one, a tall, thin gentleman,
      was sitting at the piano, singing, and striking the keys with his long,
      thin fingers. The others were listening and grinning with enjoyment.
      Kryukov looked himself up and down in the looking-glass, and was about to
      go into the hall, when Susanna Moiseyevna herself darted into the entry,
      in high spirits and wearing the same black dress. . . . Seeing Kryukov,
      she was petrified for an instant, then she uttered a little scream and
      beamed with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; she said, clutching his hand. &ldquo;What a surprise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; smiled Kryukov, putting his arm round her waist. &ldquo;Well!
      Does the destiny of Europe still lie in the hands of the French and the
      Russians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; laughed the Jewess, cautiously removing his arm. &ldquo;Come, go
      into the hall; they&rsquo;re all friends there. . . . I&rsquo;ll go and tell them to
      bring you some tea. Your name&rsquo;s Alexey, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, go in, I&rsquo;ll come
      directly. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blew him a kiss and ran out of the entry, leaving behind her the same
      sickly smell of jasmine. Kryukov raised his head and walked into the hall.
      He was on terms of friendly intimacy with all the men in the room, but
      scarcely nodded to them; they, too, scarcely responded, as though the
      places in which they met were not quite decent, and as though they were in
      tacit agreement with one another that it was more suitable for them not to
      recognise one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hall Kryukov walked into the drawing-room, and from it into a
      second drawing-room. On the way he met three or four other guests, also
      men whom he knew, though they barely recognised him. Their faces were
      flushed with drink and merriment. Alexey Ivanovitch glanced furtively at
      them and marvelled that these men, respectable heads of families, who had
      known sorrow and privation, could demean themselves to such pitiful, cheap
      gaiety! He shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are places,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;where a sober man feels sick, and a
      drunken man rejoices. I remember I never could go to the operetta or the
      gipsies when I was sober: wine makes a man more good-natured and
      reconciles him with vice. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stood still, petrified, and caught hold of the door-post with
      both hands. At the writing-table in Susanna&rsquo;s study was sitting Lieutenant
      Alexandr Grigoryevitch. He was discussing something in an undertone with a
      fat, flabby-looking Jew, and seeing his cousin, flushed crimson and looked
      down at an album.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of decency was stirred in Kryukov and the blood rushed to his
      head. Overwhelmed with amazement, shame, and anger, he walked up to the
      table without a word. Sokolsky&rsquo;s head sank lower than ever. His face
      worked with an expression of agonising shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you, Alyosha!&rdquo; he articulated, making a desperate effort to
      raise his eyes and to smile. &ldquo;I called here to say good-bye, and, as you
      see. . . . But to-morrow I am certainly going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to him? What?&rdquo; thought Alexey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;How can I judge
      him since I&rsquo;m here myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And clearing his throat without uttering a word, he went out slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call her not heavenly, and leave her on earth. . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bass was singing in the hall. A little while after, Kryukov&rsquo;s racing
      droshky was bumping along the dusty road.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>YOTR MIHALITCH
      IVASHIN was very much out of humour: his sister, a young girl, had gone
      away to live with Vlassitch, a married man. To shake off the despondency
      and depression which pursued him at home and in the fields, he called to
      his aid his sense of justice, his genuine and noble ideas&mdash;he had
      always defended free-love! &mdash;but this was of no avail, and he always
      came back to the same conclusion as their foolish old nurse, that his
      sister had acted wrongly and that Vlassitch had abducted his sister. And
      that was distressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother did not leave her room all day long; the old nurse kept sighing
      and speaking in whispers; his aunt had been on the point of taking her
      departure every day, and her trunks were continually being brought down to
      the hall and carried up again to her room. In the house, in the yard, and
      in the garden it was as still as though there were some one dead in the
      house. His aunt, the servants, and even the peasants, so it seemed to
      Pyotr Mihalitch, looked at him enigmatically and with perplexity, as
      though they wanted to say &ldquo;Your sister has been seduced; why are you doing
      nothing?&rdquo; And he reproached himself for inactivity, though he did not know
      precisely what action he ought to have taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed six days. On the seventh&mdash;it was Sunday afternoon&mdash;a
      messenger on horseback brought a letter. The address was in a familiar
      feminine handwriting: &ldquo;Her Excy. Anna Nikolaevna Ivashin.&rdquo; Pyotr Mihalitch
      fancied that there was something defiant, provocative, in the handwriting
      and in the abbreviation &ldquo;Excy.&rdquo; And advanced ideas in women are obstinate,
      ruthless, cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d rather die than make any concession to her unhappy mother, or beg
      her forgiveness,&rdquo; thought Pyotr Mihalitch, as he went to his mother with
      the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was lying on her bed, dressed. Seeing her son, she rose
      impulsively, and straightening her grey hair, which had fallen from under
      her cap, asked quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has come . . .&rdquo; said her son, giving her the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zina&rsquo;s name, and even the pronoun &ldquo;she&rdquo; was not uttered in the house. Zina
      was spoken of impersonally: &ldquo;this has come,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone away,&rdquo; and so on. . . .
      The mother recognised her daughter&rsquo;s handwriting, and her face grew ugly
      and unpleasant, and her grey hair escaped again from her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, with a motion of her hands, as though the letter scorched
      her fingers. &ldquo;No, no, never! Nothing would induce me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother broke into hysterical sobs of grief and shame; she evidently
      longed to read the letter, but her pride prevented her. Pyotr Mihalitch
      realised that he ought to open the letter himself and read it aloud, but
      he was overcome by anger such as he had never felt before; he ran out into
      the yard and shouted to the messenger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say there will be no answer! There will be no answer! Tell them that, you
      beast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he tore up the letter; then tears came into his eyes, and feeling that
      he was cruel, miserable, and to blame, he went out into the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only twenty-seven, but he was already stout. He dressed like an old
      man in loose, roomy clothes, and suffered from asthma. He already seemed
      to be developing the characteristics of an elderly country bachelor. He
      never fell in love, never thought of marriage, and loved no one but his
      mother, his sister, his old nurse, and the gardener, Vassilitch. He was
      fond of good fare, of his nap after dinner, and of talking about politics
      and exalted subjects. He had in his day taken his degree at the
      university, but he now looked upon his studies as though in them he had
      discharged a duty incumbent upon young men between the ages of eighteen
      and twenty-five; at any rate, the ideas which now strayed every day
      through his mind had nothing in common with the university or the subjects
      he had studied there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fields it was hot and still, as though rain were coming. It was
      steaming in the wood, and there was a heavy fragrant scent from the pines
      and rotting leaves. Pyotr Mihalitch stopped several times and wiped his
      wet brow. He looked at his winter corn and his spring oats, walked round
      the clover-field, and twice drove away a partridge with its chicks which
      had strayed in from the wood. And all the while he was thinking that this
      insufferable state of things could not go on for ever, and that he must
      end it one way or another. End it stupidly, madly, but he must end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how? What can I do?&rdquo; he asked himself, and looked imploringly at the
      sky and at the trees, as though begging for their help.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sky and the trees were mute. His noble ideas were no help, and his
      common sense whispered that the agonising question could have no solution
      but a stupid one, and that to-day&rsquo;s scene with the messenger was not the
      last one of its kind. It was terrible to think what was in store for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he returned home the sun was setting. By now it seemed to him that the
      problem was incapable of solution. He could not accept the accomplished
      fact, and he could not refuse to accept it, and there was no intermediate
      course. When, taking off his hat and fanning himself with his
      handkerchief, he was walking along the road, and had only another mile and
      a half to go before he would reach home, he heard bells behind him. It was
      a very choice and successful combination of bells, which gave a clear
      crystal note. No one had such bells on his horses but the police captain,
      Medovsky, formerly an officer in the hussars, a man in broken-down health,
      who had been a great rake and spendthrift, and was a distant relation of
      Pyotr Mihalitch. He was like one of the family at the Ivashins&rsquo; and had a
      tender, fatherly affection for Zina, as well as a great admiration for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming to see you,&rdquo; he said, overtaking Pyotr Mihalitch. &ldquo;Get in;
      I&rsquo;ll give you a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling and looked cheerful. Evidently he did not yet know that
      Zina had gone to live with Vlassitch; perhaps he had been told of it
      already, but did not believe it. Pyotr Mihalitch felt in a difficult
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very welcome,&rdquo; he muttered, blushing till the tears came into his
      eyes, and not knowing how to lie or what to say. &ldquo;I am delighted,&rdquo; he went
      on, trying to smile, &ldquo;but . . . Zina is away and mother is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How annoying!&rdquo; said the police captain, looking pensively at Pyotr
      Mihalitch. &ldquo;And I was meaning to spend the evening with you. Where has
      Zinaida Mihalovna gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Sinitskys&rsquo;, and I believe she meant to go from there to the
      monastery. I don&rsquo;t quite know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police captain talked a little longer and then turned back. Pyotr
      Mihalitch walked home, and thought with horror what the police captain&rsquo;s
      feelings would be when he learned the truth. And Pyotr Mihalitch imagined
      his feelings, and actually experiencing them himself, went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord help us,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Lord help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At evening tea the only one at the table was his aunt. As usual, her face
      wore the expression that seemed to say that though she was a weak,
      defenceless woman, she would allow no one to insult her. Pyotr Mihalitch
      sat down at the other end of the table (he did not like his aunt) and
      began drinking tea in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother has had no dinner again to-day,&rdquo; said his aunt. &ldquo;You ought to
      do something about it, Petrusha. Starving oneself is no help in sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck Pyotr Mihalitch as absurd that his aunt should meddle in other
      people&rsquo;s business and should make her departure depend on Zina&rsquo;s having
      gone away. He was tempted to say something rude to her, but restrained
      himself. And as he restrained himself he felt the time had come for
      action, and that he could not bear it any longer. Either he must act at
      once or fall on the ground, and scream and bang his head upon the floor.
      He pictured Vlassitch and Zina, both of them progressive and
      self-satisfied, kissing each other somewhere under a maple tree, and all
      the anger and bitterness that had been accumulating in him for the last
      seven days fastened upon Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has seduced and abducted my sister,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;another will come
      and murder my mother, a third will set fire to the house and sack the
      place. . . . And all this under the mask of friendship, lofty ideas,
      unhappiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it shall not be!&rdquo; Pyotr Mihalitch cried suddenly, and he brought his
      fist down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and ran out of the dining-room. In the stable the steward&rsquo;s
      horse was standing ready saddled. He got on it and galloped off to
      Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a perfect tempest within him. He felt a longing to do something
      extraordinary, startling, even if he had to repent of it all his life
      afterwards. Should he call Vlassitch a blackguard, slap him in the face,
      and then challenge him to a duel? But Vlassitch was not one of those men
      who do fight duels; being called a blackguard and slapped in the face
      would only make him more unhappy, and would make him shrink into himself
      more than ever. These unhappy, defenceless people are the most
      insufferable, the most tiresome creatures in the world. They can do
      anything with impunity. When the luckless man responds to well-deserved
      reproach by looking at you with eyes full of deep and guilty feeling, and
      with a sickly smile bends his head submissively, even justice itself could
      not lift its hand against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. I&rsquo;ll horsewhip him before her eyes and tell him what I think
      of him,&rdquo; Pyotr Mihalitch decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was riding through his wood and waste land, and he imagined Zina would
      try to justify her conduct by talking about the rights of women and
      individual freedom, and about there being no difference between legal
      marriage and free union. Like a woman, she would argue about what she did
      not understand. And very likely at the end she would ask, &ldquo;How do you come
      in? What right have you to interfere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have no right,&rdquo; muttered Pyotr Mihalitch. &ldquo;But so much the better.
      . . . The harsher I am, the less right I have to interfere, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was sultry. Clouds of gnats hung over the ground and in the waste
      places the peewits called plaintively. Everything betokened rain, but he
      could not see a cloud in the sky. Pyotr Mihalitch crossed the boundary of
      his estate and galloped over a smooth, level field. He often went along
      this road and knew every bush, every hollow in it. What now in the far
      distance looked in the dusk like a dark cliff was a red church; he could
      picture it all down to the smallest detail, even the plaster on the gate
      and the calves that were always grazing in the church enclosure.
      Three-quarters of a mile to the right of the church there was a copse like
      a dark blur&mdash;it was Count Koltonovitch&rsquo;s. And beyond the church
      Vlassitch&rsquo;s estate began.
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind the church and the count&rsquo;s copse a huge black storm-cloud was
      rising, and there were ashes of white lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; thought Pyotr Mihalitch. &ldquo;Lord help us, Lord help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse was soon tired after its quick gallop, and Pyotr Mihalitch was
      tired too. The storm-cloud looked at him angrily and seemed to advise him
      to go home. He felt a little scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will prove to them they are wrong,&rdquo; he tried to reassure himself. &ldquo;They
      will say that it is free-love, individual freedom; but freedom means
      self-control and not subjection to passion. It&rsquo;s not liberty but license!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached the count&rsquo;s big pond; it looked dark blue and frowning under
      the cloud, and a smell of damp and slime rose from it. Near the dam, two
      willows, one old and one young, drooped tenderly towards one another.
      Pyotr Mihalitch and Vlassitch had been walking near this very spot only a
      fortnight before, humming a students&rsquo; song:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Youth is wasted, life is nought, when the heart is cold and loveless.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wretched song!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thundering as Pyotr Mihalitch rode through the copse, and the trees
      were bending and rustling in the wind. He had to make haste. It was only
      three-quarters of a mile through a meadow from the copse to Vlassitch&rsquo;s
      house. Here there were old birch-trees on each side of the road. They had
      the same melancholy and unhappy air as their owner Vlassitch, and looked
      as tall and lanky as he. Big drops of rain pattered on the birches and on
      the grass; the wind had suddenly dropped, and there was a smell of wet
      earth and poplars. Before him he saw Vlassitch&rsquo;s fence with a row of
      yellow acacias, which were tall and lanky too; where the fence was broken
      he could see the neglected orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch was not thinking now of the horsewhip or of a slap in the
      face, and did not know what he would do at Vlassitch&rsquo;s. He felt nervous.
      He felt frightened on his own account and on his sister&rsquo;s, and was
      terrified at the thought of seeing her. How would she behave with her
      brother? What would they both talk about? And had he not better go back
      before it was too late? As he made these reflections, he galloped up the
      avenue of lime-trees to the house, rode round the big clumps of lilacs,
      and suddenly saw Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vlassitch, wearing a cotton shirt, and top-boots, bending forward, with no
      hat on in the rain, was coming from the corner of the house to the front
      door. He was followed by a workman with a hammer and a box of nails. They
      must have been mending a shutter which had been banging in the wind.
      Seeing Pyotr Mihalitch, Vlassitch stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve come, as you see,&rdquo; said Pyotr Mihalitch, brushing the rain off
      himself with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s capital! I&rsquo;m very glad,&rdquo; said Vlassitch, but he did not hold
      out his hand: evidently he did not venture, but waited for Pyotr Mihalitch
      to hold out his. &ldquo;It will do the oats good,&rdquo; he said, looking at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the house in silence. To the right of the hall was a door
      leading to another hall and then to the drawing-room, and on the left was
      a little room which in winter was used by the steward. Pyotr Mihalitch and
      Vlassitch went into this little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you caught in the rain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far off, quite close to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch sat down on the bed. He was glad of the noise of the rain
      and the darkness of the room. It was better: it made it less dreadful, and
      there was no need to see his companion&rsquo;s face. There was no anger in his
      heart now, nothing but fear and vexation with himself. He felt he had made
      a bad beginning, and that nothing would come of this visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent for some time and affected to be listening to the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Petrusha,&rdquo; Vlassitch began, clearing his throat. &ldquo;I am very
      grateful to you for coming. It&rsquo;s generous and noble of you. I understand
      it, and, believe me, I appreciate it. Believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window and went on, standing in the middle of the
      room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything happened so secretly, as though we were concealing it all from
      you. The feeling that you might be wounded and angry has been a blot on
      our happiness all these days. But let me justify myself. We kept it secret
      not because we did not trust you. To begin with, it all happened suddenly,
      by a kind of inspiration; there was no time to discuss it. Besides, it&rsquo;s
      such a private, delicate matter, and it was awkward to bring a third
      person in, even some one as intimate as you. Above all, in all this we
      reckoned on your generosity. You are a very noble and generous person. I
      am infinitely grateful to you. If you ever need my life, come and take
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vlassitch talked in a quiet, hollow bass, always on the same droning note;
      he was evidently agitated. Pyotr Mihalitch felt it was his turn to speak,
      and that to listen and keep silent would really mean playing the part of a
      generous and noble simpleton, and that had not been his idea in coming. He
      got up quickly and said, breathlessly in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Grigory. You know I liked you and could have desired no better
      husband for my sister; but what has happened is awful! It&rsquo;s terrible to
      think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it terrible?&rdquo; asked Vlassitch, with a quiver in his voice. &ldquo;It
      would be terrible if we had done wrong, but that isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Grigory. You know I have no prejudices; but, excuse my frankness,
      to my mind you have both acted selfishly. Of course, I shan&rsquo;t say so to my
      sister&mdash;it will distress her; but you ought to know: mother is
      miserable beyond all description.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s sad,&rdquo; sighed Vlassitch. &ldquo;We foresaw that, Petrusha, but what
      could we have done? Because one&rsquo;s actions hurt other people, it doesn&rsquo;t
      prove that they are wrong. What&rsquo;s to be done! Every important step one
      takes is bound to distress somebody. If you went to fight for freedom,
      that would distress your mother, too. What&rsquo;s to be done! Any one who puts
      the peace of his family before everything has to renounce the life of
      ideas completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vivid flash of lightning at the window, and the lightning
      seemed to change the course of Vlassitch&rsquo;s thoughts. He sat down beside
      Pyotr Mihalitch and began saying what was utterly beside the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have such a reverence for your sister, Petrusha,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I used
      to come and see you, I felt as though I were going to a holy shrine, and I
      really did worship Zina. Now my reverence for her grows every day. For me
      she is something higher than a wife&mdash;yes, higher!&rdquo; Vlassitch waved
      his hands. &ldquo;She is my holy of holies. Since she is living with me, I enter
      my house as though it were a temple. She is an extraordinary, rare, most
      noble woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s off now!&rdquo; thought Pyotr Mihalitch; he disliked the word
      &ldquo;woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be married properly?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How much does your
      wife want for a divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a lot. But if we were to negotiate with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t take a farthing less. She is an awful woman, brother,&rdquo; sighed
      Vlassitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never talked to you about her before&mdash;it was
      unpleasant to think of her; but now that the subject has come up, I&rsquo;ll
      tell you about her. I married her on the impulse of the moment&mdash;a
      fine, honourable impulse. An officer in command of a battalion of our
      regiment&mdash;if you care to hear the details&mdash;had an affair with a
      girl of eighteen; that is, to put it plainly, he seduced her, lived with
      her for two months, and abandoned her. She was in an awful position,
      brother. She was ashamed to go home to her parents; besides, they wouldn&rsquo;t
      have received her. Her lover had abandoned her; there was nothing left for
      her but to go to the barracks and sell herself. The other officers in the
      regiment were indignant. They were by no means saints themselves, but the
      baseness of it was so striking. Besides, no one in the regiment could
      endure the man. And to spite him, you understand, the indignant
      lieutenants and ensigns began getting up a subscription for the
      unfortunate girl. And when we subalterns met together and began to
      subscribe five or ten roubles each, I had a sudden inspiration. I felt it
      was an opportunity to do something fine. I hastened to the girl and warmly
      expressed my sympathy. And while I was on my way to her, and while I was
      talking to her, I loved her fervently as a woman insulted and injured.
      Yes. . . . Well, a week later I made her an offer. The colonel and my
      comrades thought my marriage out of keeping with the dignity of an
      officer. That roused me more than ever. I wrote a long letter, do you
      know, in which I proved that my action ought to be inscribed in the annals
      of the regiment in letters of gold, and so on. I sent the letter to my
      colonel and copies to my comrades. Well, I was excited, and, of course, I
      could not avoid being rude. I was asked to leave the regiment. I have a
      rough copy of it put away somewhere; I&rsquo;ll give it to you to read sometime.
      It was written with great feeling. You will see what lofty and noble
      sentiments I was experiencing. I resigned my commission and came here with
      my wife. My father had left a few debts, I had no money, and from the
      first day my wife began making acquaintances, dressing herself smartly,
      and playing cards, and I was obliged to mortgage the estate. She led a bad
      life, you understand, and you are the only one of the neighbours who
      hasn&rsquo;t been her lover. After two years I gave her all I had to set me free
      and she went off to town. Yes. . . . And now I pay her twelve hundred
      roubles a year. She is an awful woman! There is a fly, brother, which lays
      an egg in the back of a spider so that the spider can&rsquo;t shake it off: the
      grub fastens upon the spider and drinks its heart&rsquo;s blood. That was how
      this woman fastened upon me and sucks the blood of my heart. She hates and
      despises me for being so stupid; that is, for marrying a woman like her.
      My chivalry seems to her despicable. &lsquo;A wise man cast me off,&rsquo; she says,
      &lsquo;and a fool picked me up.&rsquo; To her thinking no one but a pitiful idiot
      could have behaved as I did. And that is insufferably bitter to me,
      brother. Altogether, I may say in parenthesis, fate has been hard upon me,
      very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch listened to Vlassitch and wondered in perplexity what it
      was in this man that had so charmed his sister. He was not young&mdash;he
      was forty-one&mdash;lean and lanky, narrow-chested, with a long nose, and
      grey hairs in his beard. He talked in a droning voice, had a sickly smile,
      and waved his hands awkwardly as he talked. He had neither health, nor
      pleasant, manly manners, nor <i>savoir-faire</i>, nor gaiety, and in all
      his exterior there was something colourless and indefinite. He dressed
      without taste, his surroundings were depressing, he did not care for
      poetry or painting because &ldquo;they have no answer to give to the questions
      of the day&rdquo; &mdash;that is, he did not understand them; music did not
      touch him. He was a poor farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His estate was in a wretched condition and was mortgaged; he was paying
      twelve percent on the second mortgage and owed ten thousand on personal
      securities as well. When the time came to pay the interest on the mortgage
      or to send money to his wife, he asked every one to lend him money with as
      much agitation as though his house were on fire, and, at the same time
      losing his head, he would sell the whole of his winter store of fuel for
      five roubles and a stack of straw for three roubles, and then have his
      garden fence or old cucumber-frames chopped up to heat his stoves. His
      meadows were ruined by pigs, the peasants&rsquo; cattle strayed in the
      undergrowth in his woods, and every year the old trees were fewer and
      fewer: beehives and rusty pails lay about in his garden and
      kitchen-garden. He had neither talents nor abilities, nor even ordinary
      capacity for living like other people. In practical life he was a weak,
      naïve man, easy to deceive and to cheat, and the peasants with good reason
      called him &ldquo;simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a Liberal, and in the district was regarded as a &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; but even
      his progressiveness was a bore. There was no originality nor moving power
      about his independent views: he was revolted, indignant, and delighted
      always on the same note; it was always spiritless and ineffective. Even in
      moments of strong enthusiasm he never raised his head or stood upright.
      But the most tiresome thing of all was that he managed to express even his
      best and finest ideas so that they seemed in him commonplace and out of
      date. It reminded one of something old one had read long ago, when slowly
      and with an air of profundity he would begin discoursing of his noble,
      lofty moments, of his best years; or when he went into raptures over the
      younger generation, which has always been, and still is, in advance of
      society; or abused Russians for donning their dressing-gowns at thirty and
      forgetting the principles of their <i>alma mater</i>. If you stayed the
      night with him, he would put Pissarev or Darwin on your bedroom table; if
      you said you had read it, he would go and bring Dobrolubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the district this was called free-thinking, and many people looked upon
      this free-thinking as an innocent and harmless eccentricity; it made him
      profoundly unhappy, however. It was for him the maggot of which he had
      just been speaking; it had fastened upon him and was sucking his
      life-blood. In his past there had been the strange marriage in the style
      of Dostoevsky; long letters and copies written in a bad, unintelligible
      hand-writing, but with great feeling, endless misunderstandings,
      explanations, disappointments, then debts, a second mortgage, the
      allowance to his wife, the monthly borrowing of money&mdash;and all this
      for no benefit to any one, either himself or others. And in the present,
      as in the past, he was still in a nervous flurry, on the lookout for
      heroic actions, and poking his nose into other people&rsquo;s affairs; as
      before, at every favourable opportunity there were long letters and
      copies, wearisome, stereotyped conversations about the village community,
      or the revival of handicrafts or the establishment of cheese factories&mdash;conversations
      as like one another as though he had prepared them, not in his living
      brain, but by some mechanical process. And finally this scandal with Zina
      of which one could not see the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile Zina was young&mdash;she was only twenty-two&mdash;good-looking,
      elegant, gay; she was fond of laughing, chatter, argument, a passionate
      musician; she had good taste in dress, in furniture, in books, and in her
      own home she would not have put up with a room like this, smelling of
      boots and cheap vodka. She, too, had advanced ideas, but in her
      free-thinking one felt the overflow of energy, the vanity of a young,
      strong, spirited girl, passionately eager to be better and more original
      than others. . . . How had it happened that she had fallen in love with
      Vlassitch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Quixote, an obstinate fanatic, a maniac,&rdquo; thought Pyotr
      Mihalitch, &ldquo;and she is as soft, yielding, and weak in character as I am. .
      . . She and I give in easily, without resistance. She loves him; but,
      then, I, too, love him in spite of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch considered Vlassitch a good, straightforward man, but
      narrow and one-sided. In his perturbations and his sufferings, and in fact
      in his whole life, he saw no lofty aims, remote or immediate; he saw
      nothing but boredom and incapacity for life. His self-sacrifice and all
      that Vlassitch himself called heroic actions or noble impulses seemed to
      him a useless waste of force, unnecessary blank shots which consumed a
      great deal of powder. And Vlassitch&rsquo;s fanatical belief in the
      extraordinary loftiness and faultlessness of his own way of thinking
      struck him as naïve and even morbid; and the fact that Vlassitch all his
      life had contrived to mix the trivial with the exalted, that he had made a
      stupid marriage and looked upon it as an act of heroism, and then had
      affairs with other women and regarded that as a triumph of some idea or
      other was simply incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Pyotr Mihalitch was fond of Vlassitch; he was conscious of a
      sort of power in him, and for some reason he had never had the heart to
      contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vlassitch sat down quite close to him for a talk in the dark, to the
      accompaniment of the rain, and he had cleared his throat as a prelude to
      beginning on something lengthy, such as the history of his marriage. But
      it was intolerable for Pyotr Mihalitch to listen to him; he was tormented
      by the thought that he would see his sister directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve had bad luck,&rdquo; he said gently; &ldquo;but, excuse me, we&rsquo;ve been
      wandering from the point. That&rsquo;s not what we are talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, quite so. Well, let us come back to the point,&rdquo; said Vlassitch,
      and he stood up. &ldquo;I tell you, Petrusha, our conscience is clear. We are
      not married, but there is no need for me to prove to you that our marriage
      is perfectly legitimate. You are as free in your ideas as I am, and,
      happily, there can be no disagreement between us on that point. As for our
      future, that ought not to alarm you. I&rsquo;ll work in the sweat of my brow,
      I&rsquo;ll work day and night&mdash; in fact, I will strain every nerve to make
      Zina happy. Her life will be a splendid one! You may ask, am I able to do
      it. I am, brother! When a man devotes every minute to one thought, it&rsquo;s
      not difficult for him to attain his object. But let us go to Zina; it will
      be a joy to her to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch&rsquo;s heart began to beat. He got up and followed Vlassitch
      into the hall, and from there into the drawing-room. There was nothing in
      the huge gloomy room but a piano and a long row of old chairs ornamented
      with bronze, on which no one ever sat. There was a candle alight on the
      piano. From the drawing-room they went in silence into the dining-room.
      This room, too, was large and comfortless; in the middle of the room there
      was a round table with two leaves with six thick legs, and only one
      candle. A clock in a large mahogany case like an ikon stand pointed to
      half-past two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vlassitch opened the door into the next room and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zina, here is Petrusha come to see us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once there was the sound of hurried footsteps and Zina came into the
      dining-room. She was tall, plump, and very pale, and, just as when he had
      seen her for the last time at home, she was wearing a black skirt and a
      red blouse, with a large buckle on her belt. She flung one arm round her
      brother and kissed him on the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a storm!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Grigory went off somewhere and I was left quite
      alone in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not embarrassed, and looked at her brother as frankly and candidly
      as at home; looking at her, Pyotr Mihalitch, too, lost his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not afraid of storms,&rdquo; he said, sitting down at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but here the rooms are so big, the house is so old, and
      when there is thunder it all rattles like a cupboard full of crockery.
      It&rsquo;s a charming house altogether,&rdquo; she went on, sitting down opposite her
      brother. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some pleasant memory in every room. In my room, only
      fancy, Grigory&rsquo;s grandfather shot himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In August we shall have the money to do up the lodge in the garden,&rdquo; said
      Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some reason when it thunders I think of that grandfather,&rdquo; Zina went
      on. &ldquo;And in this dining-room somebody was flogged to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an actual fact,&rdquo; said Vlassitch, and he looked with wide-open eyes
      at Pyotr Mihalitch. &ldquo;Sometime in the forties this place was let to a
      Frenchman called Olivier. The portrait of his daughter is lying in an
      attic now&mdash;a very pretty girl. This Olivier, so my father told me,
      despised Russians for their ignorance and treated them with cruel
      derision. Thus, for instance, he insisted on the priest walking without
      his hat for half a mile round his house, and on the church bells being
      rung when the Olivier family drove through the village. The serfs and
      altogether the humble of this world, of course, he treated with even less
      ceremony. Once there came along this road one of the simple-hearted sons
      of wandering Russia, somewhat after the style of Gogol&rsquo;s divinity student,
      Homa Brut. He asked for a night&rsquo;s lodging, pleased the bailiffs, and was
      given a job at the office of the estate. There are many variations of the
      story. Some say the divinity student stirred up the peasants, others that
      Olivier&rsquo; s daughter fell in love with him. I don&rsquo;t know which is true,
      only one fine evening Olivier called him in here and cross-examined him,
      then ordered him to be beaten. Do you know, he sat here at this table
      drinking claret while the stable-boys beat the man. He must have tried to
      wring something out of him. Towards morning the divinity student died of
      the torture and his body was hidden. They say it was thrown into
      Koltovitch&rsquo;s pond. There was an inquiry, but the Frenchman paid some
      thousands to some one in authority and went away to Alsace. His lease was
      up just then, and so the matter ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What scoundrels!&rdquo; said Zina, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father remembered Olivier and his daughter well. He used to say she
      was remarkably beautiful and eccentric. I imagine the divinity student had
      done both&mdash;stirred up the peasants and won the daughter&rsquo;s heart.
      Perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t a divinity student at all, but some one travelling
      incognito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zina grew thoughtful; the story of the divinity student and the beautiful
      French girl had evidently carried her imagination far away. It seemed to
      Pyotr Mihalitch that she had not changed in the least during the last
      week, except that she was a little paler. She looked calm and just as
      usual, as though she had come with her brother to visit Vlassitch. But
      Pyotr Mihalitch felt that some change had taken place in himself. Before,
      when she was living at home, he could have spoken to her about anything,
      and now he did not feel equal to asking her the simple question, &ldquo;How do
      you like being here?&rdquo; The question seemed awkward and unnecessary.
      Probably the same change had taken place in her. She was in no haste to
      turn the conversation to her mother, to her home, to her relations with
      Vlassitch; she did not defend herself, she did not say that free unions
      are better than marriages in the church; she was not agitated, and calmly
      brooded over the story of Olivier. . . . And why had they suddenly begun
      talking of Olivier?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both of you wet with the rain,&rdquo; said Zina, and she smiled
      joyfully; she was touched by this point of resemblance between her brother
      and Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pyotr Mihalitch felt all the bitterness and horror of his position. He
      thought of his deserted home, the closed piano, and Zina&rsquo;s bright little
      room into which no one went now; he thought there were no prints of little
      feet on the garden-paths, and that before tea no one went off, laughing
      gaily, to bathe. What he had clung to more and more from his childhood
      upwards, what he had loved thinking about when he used to sit in the
      stuffy class-room or the lecture theatre&mdash;brightness, purity, and
      joy, everything that filled the house with life and light, had gone never
      to return, had vanished, and was mixed up with a coarse, clumsy story of
      some battalion officer, a chivalrous lieutenant, a depraved woman and a
      grandfather who had shot himself. . . . And to begin to talk about his
      mother or to think that the past could ever return would mean not
      understanding what was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears and his hand began to tremble as
      it lay on the table. Zina guessed what he was thinking about, and her
      eyes, too, glistened and looked red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grigory, come here,&rdquo; she said to Vlassitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked away to the window and began talking of something in a
      whisper. From the way that Vlassitch stooped down to her and the way she
      looked at him, Pyotr Mihalitch realised again that everything was
      irreparably over, and that it was no use to talk of anything. Zina went
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, brother!&rdquo; Vlassitch began, after a brief silence, rubbing his hands
      and smiling. &ldquo;I called our life happiness just now, but that was, so to
      speak, poetical license. In reality, there has not been a sense of
      happiness so far. Zina has been thinking all the time of you, of her
      mother, and has been worrying; looking at her, I, too, felt worried. Hers
      is a bold, free nature, but, you know, it&rsquo;s difficult when you&rsquo;re not used
      to it, and she is young, too. The servants call her &lsquo;Miss&rsquo;; it seems a
      trifle, but it upsets her. There it is, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zina brought in a plateful of strawberries. She was followed by a little
      maidservant, looking crushed and humble, who set a jug of milk on the
      table and made a very low bow: she had something about her that was in
      keeping with the old furniture, something petrified and dreary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the rain had ceased. Pyotr Mihalitch ate strawberries while
      Vlassitch and Zina looked at him in silence. The moment of the inevitable
      but useless conversation was approaching, and all three felt the burden of
      it. Pyotr Mihalitch&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears again; he pushed away his
      plate and said that he must be going home, or it would be getting late,
      and perhaps it would rain again. The time had come when common decency
      required Zina to speak of those at home and of her new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are things at home?&rdquo; she asked rapidly, and her pale face quivered.
      &ldquo;How is mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know mother . . .&rdquo; said Pyotr Mihalitch, not looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petrusha, you&rsquo;ve thought a great deal about what has happened,&rdquo; she said,
      taking hold of her brother&rsquo;s sleeve, and he knew how hard it was for her
      to speak. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve thought a great deal: tell me, can we reckon on mother&rsquo;s
      accepting Grigory . . . and the whole position, one day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood close to her brother, face to face with him, and he was
      astonished that she was so beautiful, and that he seemed not to have
      noticed it before. And it seemed to him utterly absurd that his sister, so
      like his mother, pampered, elegant, should be living with Vlassitch and in
      Vlassitch&rsquo;s house, with the petrified servant, and the table with six legs&mdash;in
      the house where a man had been flogged to death, and that she was not
      going home with him, but was staying here to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know mother,&rdquo; he said, not answering her question. &ldquo;I think you ought
      to have . . . to do something, to ask her forgiveness or something. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to ask her forgiveness would mean pretending we had done wrong. I&rsquo;m
      ready to tell a lie to comfort mother, but it won&rsquo;t lead anywhere. I know
      mother. Well, what will be, must be!&rdquo; said Zina, growing more cheerful now
      that the most unpleasant had been said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for five years, ten
      years, and be patient, and then God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her brother&rsquo;s arm, and when she walked through the dark hall she
      squeezed close to him. They went out on the steps. Pyotr Mihalitch said
      good-bye, got on his horse, and set off at a walk; Zina and Vlassitch
      walked a little way with him. It was still and warm, with a delicious
      smell of hay; stars were twinkling brightly between the clouds.
      Vlassitch&rsquo;s old garden, which had seen so many gloomy stories in its time,
      lay slumbering in the darkness, and for some reason it was mournful riding
      through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zina and I to-day after dinner spent some really exalted moments,&rdquo; said
      Vlassitch. &ldquo;I read aloud to her an excellent article on the question of
      emigration. You must read it, brother! You really must. It&rsquo;s remarkable
      for its lofty tone. I could not resist writing a letter to the editor to
      be forwarded to the author. I wrote only a single line: &lsquo;I thank you and
      warmly press your noble hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pyotr Mihalitch was tempted to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t meddle in what does not concern
      you,&rdquo; but he held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vlassitch walked by his right stirrup and Zina by the left; both seemed to
      have forgotten that they had to go home. It was damp, and they had almost
      reached Koltovitch&rsquo;s copse. Pyotr Mihalitch felt that they were expecting
      something from him, though they hardly knew what it was, and he felt
      unbearably sorry for them. Now as they walked by the horse with submissive
      faces, lost in thought, he had a deep conviction that they were unhappy,
      and could not be happy, and their love seemed to him a melancholy,
      irreparable mistake. Pity and the sense that he could do nothing to help
      them reduced him to that state of spiritual softening when he was ready to
      make any sacrifice to get rid of the painful feeling of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over sometimes for a night,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it sounded as though he were making a concession, and did not satisfy
      him. When they stopped near Koltovitch&rsquo;s copse to say good-bye, he bent
      down to Zina, touched her shoulder, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Zina! You have done well.&rdquo; To avoid saying more and
      bursting into tears, he lashed his horse and galloped into the wood. As he
      rode into the darkness, he looked round and saw Vlassitch and Zina walking
      home along the road&mdash;he taking long strides, while she walked with a
      hurried, jerky step beside him&mdash;talking eagerly about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old woman!&rdquo; thought Pyotr Mihalitch. &ldquo;I went to solve the
      question and I have only made it more complicated&mdash;there it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was heavy at heart. When he got out of the copse he rode at a walk and
      then stopped his horse near the pond. He wanted to sit and think without
      moving. The moon was rising and was reflected in a streak of red on the
      other side of the pond. There were low rumbles of thunder in the distance.
      Pyotr Mihalitch looked steadily at the water and imagined his sister&rsquo;s
      despair, her martyr-like pallor, the tearless eyes with which she would
      conceal her humiliation from others. He imagined her with child, imagined
      the death of their mother, her funeral, Zina&rsquo;s horror. . . . The proud,
      superstitious old woman would be sure to die of grief. Terrible pictures
      of the future rose before him on the background of smooth, dark water, and
      among pale feminine figures he saw himself, a weak, cowardly man with a
      guilty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred paces off on the right bank of the pond, something dark was
      standing motionless: was it a man or a tall post? Pyotr Mihalitch thought
      of the divinity student who had been killed and thrown into the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olivier behaved inhumanly, but one way or another he did settle the
      question, while I have settled nothing and have only made it worse,&rdquo; he
      thought, gazing at the dark figure that looked like a ghost. &ldquo;He said and
      did what he thought right while I say and do what I don&rsquo;t think right; and
      I don&rsquo;t know really what I do think. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rode up to the dark figure: it was an old rotten post, the relic of
      some shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Koltovitch&rsquo;s copse and garden there came a strong fragrant scent of
      lilies of the valley and honey-laden flowers. Pyotr Mihalitch rode along
      the bank of the pond and looked mournfully into the water. And thinking
      about his life, he came to the conclusion he had never said or acted upon
      what he really thought, and other people had repaid him in the same way.
      And so the whole of life seemed to him as dark as this water in which the
      night sky was reflected and water-weeds grew in a tangle. And it seemed to
      him that nothing could ever set it right.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Don railway. A
      quiet, cheerless station, white and solitary in the steppe, with its walls
      baking in the sun, without a speck of shade, and, it seems, without a
      human being. The train goes on after leaving one here; the sound of it is
      scarcely audible and dies away at last. Outside the station it is a
      desert, and there are no horses but one&rsquo;s own. One gets into the carriage&mdash;which
      is so pleasant after the train&mdash;and is borne along the road through
      the steppe, and by degrees there are unfolded before one views such as one
      does not see near Moscow&mdash;immense, endless, fascinating in their
      monotony. The steppe, the steppe, and nothing more; in the distance an
      ancient barrow or a windmill; ox-waggons laden with coal trail by. . . .
      Solitary birds fly low over the plain, and a drowsy feeling comes with the
      monotonous beat of their wings. It is hot. Another hour or so passes, and
      still the steppe, the steppe, and still in the distance the barrow. The
      driver tells you something, some long unnecessary tale, pointing into the
      distance with his whip. And tranquillity takes possession of the soul; one
      is loth to think of the past. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage with three horses had been sent to fetch Vera Ivanovna Kardin.
      The driver put in her luggage and set the harness to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything just as it always has been,&rdquo; said Vera, looking about her. &ldquo;I
      was a little girl when I was here last, ten years ago. I remember old
      Boris came to fetch me then. Is he still living, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver made no reply, but, like a Little Russian, looked at her
      angrily and clambered on to the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a twenty-mile drive from the station, and Vera, too, abandoned
      herself to the charm of the steppe, forgot the past, and thought only of
      the wide expanse, of the freedom. Healthy, clever, beautiful, and young&mdash;she
      was only three-and-twenty&mdash;she had hitherto lacked nothing in her
      life but just this space and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steppe, the steppe. . . . The horses trotted, the sun rose higher and
      higher; and it seemed to Vera that never in her childhood had the steppe
      been so rich, so luxuriant in June; the wild flowers were green, yellow,
      lilac, white, and a fragrance rose from them and from the warmed earth;
      and there were strange blue birds along the roadside. . . . Vera had long
      got out of the habit of praying, but now, struggling with drowsiness, she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, grant that I may be happy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was peace and sweetness in her soul, and she felt as though she
      would have been glad to drive like that all her life, looking at the
      steppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a deep ravine overgrown with oak saplings and
      alder-trees; there was a moist feeling in the air&mdash;there must have
      been a spring at the bottom. On the near side, on the very edge of the
      ravine, a covey of partridges rose noisily. Vera remembered that in old
      days they used to go for evening walks to this ravine; so it must be near
      home! And now she could actually see the poplars, the barn, black smoke
      rising on one side&mdash;they were burning old straw. And there was Auntie
      Dasha coming to meet her and waving her handkerchief; grandfather was on
      the terrace. Oh dear, how happy she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my darling!&rdquo; cried her aunt, shrieking as though she were in
      hysterics. &ldquo;Our real mistress has come! You must understand you are our
      mistress, you are our queen! Here everything is yours! My darling, my
      beauty, I am not your aunt, but your willing slave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera had no relations but her aunt and her grandfather; her mother had
      long been dead; her father, an engineer, had died three months before at
      Kazan, on his way from Siberia. Her grandfather had a big grey beard. He
      was stout, red-faced, and asthmatic, and walked leaning on a cane and
      sticking his stomach out. Her aunt, a lady of forty-two, drawn in tightly
      at the waist and fashionably dressed with sleeves high on the shoulder,
      evidently tried to look young and was still anxious to be charming; she
      walked with tiny steps with a wriggle of her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you love us?&rdquo; she said, embracing Vera, &ldquo;You are not proud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At her grandfather&rsquo;s wish there was a thanksgiving service, then they
      spent a long while over dinner&mdash;and Vera&rsquo;s new life began. She was
      given the best room. All the rugs in the house had been put in it, and a
      great many flowers; and when at night she lay down in her snug, wide, very
      soft bed and covered herself with a silk quilt that smelt of old clothes
      long stored away, she laughed with pleasure. Auntie Dasha came in for a
      minute to wish her good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are home again, thank God,&rdquo; she said, sitting down on the bed.
      &ldquo;As you see, we get along very well and have everything we want. There&rsquo;s
      only one thing: your grandfather is in a poor way! A terribly poor way! He
      is short of breath and he has begun to lose his memory. And you remember
      how strong, how vigorous, he used to be! There was no doing anything with
      him. . . . In old days, if the servants didn&rsquo;t please him or anything else
      went wrong, he would jump up at once and shout: &lsquo;Twenty-five strokes! The
      birch!&rsquo; But now he has grown milder and you never hear him. And besides,
      times are changed, my precious; one mayn&rsquo;t beat them nowadays. Of course,
      they oughtn&rsquo;t to be beaten, but they need looking after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are they beaten now, auntie?&rdquo; asked Vera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The steward beats them sometimes, but I never do, bless their hearts! And
      your grandfather sometimes lifts his stick from old habit, but he never
      beats them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Auntie Dasha yawned and crossed herself over her mouth and her right ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not dull here?&rdquo; Vera inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I say? There are no landowners living here now, but there have
      been works built near, darling, and there are lots of engineers, doctors,
      and mine managers. Of course, we have theatricals and concerts, but we
      play cards more than anything. They come to us, too. Dr. Neshtchapov from
      the works comes to see us&mdash;such a handsome, interesting man! He fell
      in love with your photograph. I made up my mind: he is Verotchka&rsquo;s
      destiny, I thought. He&rsquo;s young, handsome, he has means&mdash;a good match,
      in fact. And of course you&rsquo;re a match for any one. You&rsquo;re of good family.
      The place is mortgaged, it&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s in good order and not
      neglected; there is my share in it, but it will all come to you; I am your
      willing slave. And my brother, your father, left you fifteen thousand
      roubles. . . . But I see you can&rsquo;t keep your eyes open. Sleep, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Vera spent a long time walking round the house. The garden, which
      was old and unattractive, lying inconveniently upon the slope, had no
      paths, and was utterly neglected; probably the care of it was regarded as
      an unnecessary item in the management. There were numbers of grass-snakes.
      Hoopoes flew about under the trees calling &ldquo;Oo-too-toot!&rdquo; as though they
      were trying to remind her of something. At the bottom of the hill there
      was a river overgrown with tall reeds, and half a mile beyond the river
      was the village. From the garden Vera went out into the fields; looking
      into the distance, thinking of her new life in her own home, she kept
      trying to grasp what was in store for her. The space, the lovely peace of
      the steppe, told her that happiness was near at hand, and perhaps was here
      already; thousands of people, in fact, would have said: &ldquo;What happiness to
      be young, healthy, well-educated, to be living on one&rsquo;s own estate!&rdquo; And
      at the same time the endless plain, all alike, without one living soul,
      frightened her, and at moments it was clear to her that its peaceful green
      vastness would swallow up her life and reduce it to nothingness. She was
      very young, elegant, fond of life; she had finished her studies at an
      aristocratic boarding-school, had learnt three languages, had read a great
      deal, had travelled with her father&mdash;and could all this have been
      meant to lead to nothing but settling down in a remote country-house in
      the steppe, and wandering day after day from the garden into the fields
      and from the fields into the garden to while away the time, and then
      sitting at home listening to her grandfather&rsquo;s breathing? But what could
      she do? Where could she go? She could find no answer, and as she was
      returning home she doubted whether she would be happy here, and thought
      that driving from the station was far more interesting than living here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Neshtchapov drove over from the works. He was a doctor, but three
      years previously he had taken a share in the works, and had become one of
      the partners; and now he no longer looked upon medicine as his chief
      vocation, though he still practised. In appearance he was a pale, dark man
      in a white waistcoat, with a good figure; but to guess what there was in
      his heart and his brain was difficult. He kissed Auntie Dasha&rsquo;s hand on
      greeting her, and was continually leaping up to set a chair or give his
      seat to some one. He was very silent and grave all the while, and, when he
      did speak, it was for some reason impossible to hear and understand his
      first sentence, though he spoke correctly and not in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You play the piano?&rdquo; he asked Vera, and immediately leapt up, as she had
      dropped her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed from midday to midnight without speaking, and Vera found him
      very unattractive. She thought that a white waistcoat in the country was
      bad form, and his elaborate politeness, his manners, and his pale, serious
      face with dark eyebrows, were mawkish; and it seemed to her that he was
      perpetually silent, probably because he was stupid. When he had gone her
      aunt said enthusiastically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Isn&rsquo;t he charming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Auntie Dasha looked after the estate. Tightly laced, with jingling
      bracelets on her wrists, she went into the kitchen, the granary, the
      cattle-yard, tripping along with tiny steps, wriggling her spine; and
      whenever she talked to the steward or to the peasants, she used, for some
      reason, to put on a pince-nez. Vera&rsquo;s grandfather always sat in the same
      place, playing patience or dozing. He ate a very great deal at dinner and
      supper; they gave him the dinner cooked to-day and what was left from
      yesterday, and cold pie left from Sunday, and salt meat from the servants&rsquo;
      dinner, and he ate it all greedily. And every dinner left on Vera such an
      impression, that when she saw afterwards a flock of sheep driven by, or
      flour being brought from the mill, she thought, &ldquo;Grandfather will eat
      that.&rdquo; For the most part he was silent, absorbed in eating or in patience;
      but it sometimes happened at dinner that at the sight of Vera he would be
      touched and say tenderly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only grandchild! Verotchka!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And tears would glisten in his eyes. Or his face would turn suddenly
      crimson, his neck would swell, he would look with fury at the servants,
      and ask, tapping with his stick:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you brought the horse-radish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In winter he led a perfectly inactive existence; in summer he sometimes
      drove out into the fields to look at the oats and the hay; and when he
      came back he would flourish his stick and declare that everything was
      neglected now that he was not there to look after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather is out of humour,&rdquo; Auntie Dasha would whisper. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      nothing now to what it used to be in the old days: &lsquo;Twenty-five strokes!
      The birch!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt complained that every one had grown lazy, that no one did
      anything, and that the estate yielded no profit. Indeed, there was no
      systematic farming; they ploughed and sowed a little simply from habit,
      and in reality did nothing and lived in idleness. Meanwhile there was a
      running to and fro, reckoning and worrying all day long; the bustle in the
      house began at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning; there were continual sounds of
      &ldquo;Bring it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; and by the evening the servants were
      utterly exhausted. Auntie Dasha changed her cooks and her housemaids every
      week; sometimes she discharged them for immorality; sometimes they went of
      their own accord, complaining that they were worked to death. None of the
      village people would come to the house as servants; Auntie Dasha had to
      hire them from a distance. There was only one girl from the village living
      in the house, Alyona, and she stayed because her whole family&mdash;old
      people and children&mdash;were living upon her wages. This Alyona, a pale,
      rather stupid little thing, spent the whole day turning out the rooms,
      waiting at table, heating the stoves, sewing, washing; but it always
      seemed as though she were only pottering about, treading heavily with her
      boots, and were nothing but a hindrance in the house. In her terror that
      she might be dismissed and sent home, she often dropped and broke the
      crockery, and they stopped the value of it out of her wages, and then her
      mother and grandmother would come and bow down at Auntie Dasha&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a week or sometimes oftener visitors would arrive. Her aunt would
      come to Vera and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should sit a little with the visitors, or else they&rsquo;ll think that you
      are stuck up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera would go in to the visitors and play <i>vint</i> with them for hours
      together, or play the piano for the visitors to dance; her aunt, in high
      spirits and breathless from dancing, would come up and whisper to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be nice to Marya Nikiforovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth of December, St. Nikolay&rsquo;s Day, a large party of about thirty
      arrived all at once; they played <i>vint</i> until late at night, and many
      of them stayed the night. In the morning they sat down to cards again,
      then they had dinner, and when Vera went to her room after dinner to rest
      from conversation and tobacco smoke, there were visitors there too, and
      she almost wept in despair. And when they began to get ready to go in the
      evening, she was so pleased they were going at last, that she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do stay a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt exhausted by the visitors and constrained by their presence; yet
      every day, as soon as it began to grow dark, something drew her out of the
      house, and she went out to pay visits either at the works or at some
      neighbours&rsquo;, and then there were cards, dancing, forfeits, suppers. . .
      .The young people in the works or in the mines sometimes sang Little
      Russian songs, and sang them very well. It made one sad to hear them sing.
      Or they all gathered together in one room and talked in the dusk of the
      mines, of the treasures that had once been buried in the steppes, of
      Saur&rsquo;s Grave. . . . Later on, as they talked, a shout of &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; sometimes
      reached them. It was a drunken man going home, or some one was being
      robbed by the pit near by. Or the wind howled in the chimneys, the
      shutters banged; then, soon afterwards, they would hear the uneasy church
      bell, as the snow-storm began.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all the evening parties, picnics, and dinners, Auntie Dasha was
      invariably the most interesting woman and the doctor the most interesting
      man. There was very little reading either at the works or at the
      country-houses; they played only marches and polkas; and the young people
      always argued hotly about things they did not understand, and the effect
      was crude. The discussions were loud and heated, but, strange to say, Vera
      had nowhere else met people so indifferent and careless as these. They
      seemed to have no fatherland, no religion, no public interests. When they
      talked of literature or debated some abstract question, it could be seen
      from Dr. Neshtchapov&rsquo;s face that the question had no interest for him
      whatever, and that for long, long years he had read nothing and cared to
      read nothing. Serious and expressionless, like a badly painted portrait,
      for ever in his white waistcoat, he was silent and incomprehensible as
      before; but the ladies, young and old, thought him interesting and were
      enthusiastic over his manners. They envied Vera, who appeared to attract
      him very much. And Vera always came away from the visits with a feeling of
      vexation, vowing inwardly to remain at home; but the day passed, the
      evening came, and she hurried off to the works again, and it was like that
      almost all the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ordered books and magazines, and used to read them in her room. And
      she read at night, lying in bed. When the clock in the corridor struck two
      or three, and her temples were beginning to ache from reading, she sat up
      in bed and thought, &ldquo;What am I to do? Where am I to go?&rdquo; Accursed,
      importunate question, to which there were a number of ready-made answers,
      and in reality no answer at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how noble, how holy, how picturesque it must be to serve the people,
      to alleviate their sufferings, to enlighten them! But she, Vera, did not
      know the people. And how could she go to them? They were strange and
      uninteresting to her; she could not endure the stuffy smell of the huts,
      the pot-house oaths, the unwashed children, the women&rsquo;s talk of illnesses.
      To walk over the snow-drifts, to feel cold, then to sit in a stifling hut,
      to teach children she disliked&mdash;no, she would rather die! And to
      teach the peasants&rsquo; children while Auntie Dasha made money out of the
      pot-houses and fined the peasants&mdash;it was too great a farce! What a
      lot of talk there was of schools, of village libraries, of universal
      education; but if all these engineers, these mine-owners and ladies of her
      acquaintance, had not been hypocrites, and really had believed that
      enlightenment was necessary, they would not have paid the schoolmasters
      fifteen roubles a month as they did now, and would not have let them go
      hungry. And the schools and the talk about ignorance&mdash;it was all only
      to stifle the voice of conscience because they were ashamed to own fifteen
      or thirty thousand acres and to be indifferent to the peasants&rsquo; lot. Here
      the ladies said about Dr. Neshtchapov that he was a kind man and had built
      a school at the works. Yes, he had built a school out of the old bricks at
      the works for some eight hundred roubles, and they sang the prayer for
      &ldquo;long life&rdquo; to him when the building was opened, but there was no chance
      of his giving up his shares, and it certainly never entered his head that
      the peasants were human beings like himself, and that they, too, needed
      university teaching, and not merely lessons in these wretched schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Vera felt full of anger against herself and every one else. She took
      up a book again and tried to read it, but soon afterwards sat down and
      thought again. To become a doctor? But to do that one must pass an
      examination in Latin; besides, she had an invincible repugnance to corpses
      and disease. It would be nice to become a mechanic, a judge, a commander
      of a steamer, a scientist; to do something into which she could put all
      her powers, physical and spiritual, and to be tired out and sleep soundly
      at night; to give up her life to something that would make her an
      interesting person, able to attract interesting people, to love, to have a
      real family of her own. . . . But what was she to do? How was she to
      begin?
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday in Lent her aunt came into her room early in the morning to
      fetch her umbrella. Vera was sitting up in bed clasping her head in her
      hands, thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to go to church, darling,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;or people will think
      you are not a believer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are dull, poor child,&rdquo; said Auntie Dasha, sinking on her knees
      by the bedside; she adored Vera. &ldquo;Tell me the truth, are you bored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beauty, my queen, I am your willing slave, I wish you nothing but good
      and happiness. . . . Tell me, why don&rsquo;t you want to marry Nestchapov? What
      more do you want, my child? You must forgive me, darling; you can&rsquo;t pick
      and choose like this, we are not princes . . . . Time is passing, you are
      not seventeen. . . . And I don&rsquo;t understand it! He loves you, idolises
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy!&rdquo; said Vera with vexation. &ldquo;How can I tell? He sits dumb and
      never says a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shy, darling. . . . He&rsquo;s afraid you&rsquo;ll refuse him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when her aunt had gone away, Vera remained standing in the middle of
      her room uncertain whether to dress or to go back to bed. The bed was
      hateful; if one looked out of the window there were the bare trees, the
      grey snow, the hateful jackdaws, the pigs that her grandfather would eat.
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, after all, perhaps I&rsquo;d better get married!&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      For two days Auntie Dasha went about with a tear-stained and heavily
      powdered face, and at dinner she kept sighing and looking towards the
      ikon. And it was impossible to make out what was the matter with her. But
      at last she made up her mind, went in to Vera, and said in a casual way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, child, we have to pay interest on the bank loan, and the
      tenant hasn&rsquo;t paid his rent. Will you let me pay it out of the fifteen
      thousand your papa left you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All day afterwards Auntie Dasha spent in making cherry jam in the garden.
      Alyona, with her cheeks flushed with the heat, ran to and from the garden
      to the house and back again to the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Auntie Dasha was making jam with a very serious face as though she
      were performing a religious rite, and her short sleeves displayed her
      strong, little, despotic hands and arms, and when the servants ran about
      incessantly, bustling about the jam which they would never taste, there
      was always a feeling of martyrdom in the air. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden smelt of hot cherries. The sun had set, the charcoal stove had
      been carried away, but the pleasant, sweetish smell still lingered in the
      air. Vera sat on a bench in the garden and watched a new labourer, a young
      soldier, not of the neighbourhood, who was, by her express orders, making
      new paths. He was cutting the turf with a spade and heaping it up on a
      barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you serving?&rdquo; Vera asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Berdyansk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you going now? Home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the labourer. &ldquo;I have no home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where were you born and brought up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the province of Oryol. Till I went into the army I lived with my
      mother, in my step-father&rsquo;s house; my mother was the head of the house,
      and people looked up to her, and while she lived I was cared for. But
      while I was in the army I got a letter telling me my mother was dead. . .
      . And now I don&rsquo;t seem to care to go home. It&rsquo;s not my own father, so it&rsquo;s
      not like my own home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your father is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I am illegitimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Auntie Dasha appeared at the window and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Il ne faut pas parler aux gens . . . .</i> Go into the kitchen, my
      good man. You can tell your story there,&rdquo; she said to the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came as yesterday and every day supper, reading, a sleepless
      night, and endless thinking about the same thing. At three o&rsquo;clock the sun
      rose; Alyona was already busy in the corridor, and Vera was not asleep yet
      and was trying to read. She heard the creak of the barrow: it was the new
      labourer at work in the garden. . . . Vera sat at the open window with a
      book, dozed, and watched the soldier making the paths for her, and that
      interested her. The paths were as even and level as a leather strap, and
      it was pleasant to imagine what they would be like when they were strewn
      with yellow sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see her aunt come out of the house soon after five o&rsquo;clock, in a
      pink wrapper and curl-papers. She stood on the steps for three minutes
      without speaking, and then said to the soldier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your passport and go in peace. I can&rsquo;t have any one illegitimate in
      my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An oppressive, angry feeling sank like a stone on Vera&rsquo;s heart. She was
      indignant with her aunt, she hated her; she was so sick of her aunt that
      her heart was full of misery and loathing. But what was she to do? To stop
      her mouth? To be rude to her? But what would be the use? Suppose she
      struggled with her, got rid of her, made her harmless, prevented her
      grandfather from flourishing his stick&mdash; what would be the use of it?
      It would be like killing one mouse or one snake in the boundless steppe.
      The vast expanse, the long winters, the monotony and dreariness of life,
      instil a sense of helplessness; the position seems hopeless, and one wants
      to do nothing&mdash;everything is useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alyona came in, and bowing low to Vera, began carrying out the arm-chairs
      to beat the dust out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have chosen a time to clean up,&rdquo; said Vera with annoyance. &ldquo;Go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alyona was overwhelmed, and in her terror could not understand what was
      wanted of her. She began hurriedly tidying up the dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out of the room, I tell you,&rdquo; Vera shouted, turning cold; she had
      never had such an oppressive feeling before. &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alyona uttered a sort of moan, like a bird, and dropped Vera&rsquo;s gold watch
      on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; Vera shrieked in a voice not her own, leaping up and trembling
      all over. &ldquo;Send her away; she worries me to death!&rdquo; she went on, walking
      rapidly after Alyona down the passage, stamping her feet. &ldquo;Go away! Birch
      her! Beat her!&rdquo; Then suddenly she came to herself, and just as she was,
      unwashed, uncombed, in her dressing-gown and slippers, she rushed out of
      the house. She ran to the familiar ravine and hid herself there among the
      sloe-trees, so that she might see no one and be seen by no one. Lying
      there motionless on the grass, she did not weep, she was not
      horror-stricken, but gazing at the sky open-eyed, she reflected coldly and
      clearly that something had happened which she could never forget and for
      which she could never forgive herself all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to take myself in
      hand, or there&rsquo;ll be no end to it. . . . I can&rsquo;t go on like this. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At midday Dr. Neshtchapov drove by the ravine on his way to the house. She
      saw him and made up her mind that she would begin a new life, and that she
      would make herself begin it, and this decision calmed her. And following
      with her eyes the doctor&rsquo;s well-built figure, she said, as though trying
      to soften the crudity of her decision:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice man. . . . We shall get through life somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned home. While she was dressing, Auntie Dasha came into the
      room, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alyona upset you, darling; I&rsquo;ve sent her home to the village. Her
      mother&rsquo;s given her a good beating and has come here, crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; said Vera quickly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Dr. Neshtchapov. Only
      talk to him yourself . . . I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again she went out into the fields. And wandering aimlessly about, she
      made up her mind that when she was married she would look after the house,
      doctor the peasants, teach in the school, that she would do all the things
      that other women of her circle did. And this perpetual dissatisfaction
      with herself and every one else, this series of crude mistakes which stand
      up like a mountain before one whenever one looks back upon one&rsquo;s past, she
      would accept as her real life to which she was fated, and she would expect
      nothing better. . . . Of course there was nothing better! Beautiful
      nature, dreams, music, told one story, but reality another. Evidently
      truth and happiness existed somewhere outside real life. . . . One must
      give up one&rsquo;s own life and merge oneself into this luxuriant steppe,
      boundless and indifferent as eternity, with its flowers, its ancient
      barrows, and its distant horizon, and then it would be well with one. . .
      .
    </p>

      A month later Vera was living at the works.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR a cultivated
      man to be ignorant of foreign languages is a great inconvenience. Vorotov
      became acutely conscious of it when, after taking his degree, he began
      upon a piece of research work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he said, breathing hard (although he was only twenty-six he
      was fat, heavy, and suffered from shortness of breath).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful! Without languages I&rsquo;m like a bird without wings. I might just

      And a young lady elaborately dressed in the last fashion walked in. She
      introduced herself as a teacher of French, Alice Osipovna Enquête, and
      told Vorotov that she had been sent to him by one of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted! Please sit down,&rdquo; said Vorotov, breathing hard and putting his
      hand over the collar of his nightshirt (to breathe more freely he always
      wore a nightshirt at work instead of a stiff linen one with collar). &ldquo;It
      was Pyotr Sergeitch sent you? Yes, yes . . . I asked him about it.
      Delighted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he talked to Mdlle. Enquête he looked at her shyly and with curiosity.
      She was a genuine Frenchwoman, very elegant and still quite young. Judging
      from her pale, languid face, her short curly hair, and her unnaturally
      slim waist, she might have been eighteen; but looking at her broad,
      well-developed shoulders, the elegant lines of her back and her severe
      eyes, Vorotov thought that she was not less than three-and-twenty and
      might be twenty-five; but then again he began to think she was not more
      than eighteen. Her face looked as cold and business-like as the face of a
      person who has come to speak about money. She did not once smile or frown,
      and only once a look of perplexity flitted over her face when she learnt
      that she was not required to teach children, but a stout grown-up man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Alice Osipovna,&rdquo; said Vorotov, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a lesson every evening
      from seven to eight. As regards your terms&mdash;a rouble a lesson&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      nothing to say against that. By all means let it be a rouble. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he asked her if she would not have some tea or coffee, whether it was
      a fine day, and with a good-natured smile, stroking the baize of the
      table, he inquired in a friendly voice who she was, where she had studied,
      and what she lived on.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cold, business-like expression, Alice Osipovna answered that she
      had completed her studies at a private school and had the diploma of a
      private teacher, that her father had died lately of scarlet fever, that
      her mother was alive and made artificial flowers; that she, Mdlle.
      Enquête, taught in a private school till dinnertime, and after dinner was
      busy till evening giving lessons in different good families.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went away leaving behind her the faint fragrance of a woman&rsquo;s clothes.
      For a long time afterwards Vorotov could not settle to work, but, sitting
      at the table stroking its green baize surface, he meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very pleasant to see a girl working to earn her own living,&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;On the other hand, it&rsquo;s very unpleasant to think that poverty
      should not spare such elegant and pretty girls as Alice Osipovna, and that
      she, too, should have to struggle for existence. It&rsquo;s a sad thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having never seen virtuous Frenchwomen before, he reflected also that this
      elegantly dressed young lady with her well-developed shoulders and
      exaggeratedly small waist in all probability followed another calling as
      well as giving French lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening when the clock pointed to five minutes to seven, Mdlle.
      Enquête appeared, rosy from the frost. She opened Margot, which she had
      brought with her, and without introduction began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French grammar has twenty-six letters. The first letter is called <i>A</i>,
      the second <i>B</i> . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Vorotov interrupted, smiling. &ldquo;I must warn you, mademoiselle,
      that you must change your method a little in my case. You see, I know
      Russian, Greek, and Latin well. . . . I&rsquo;ve studied comparative philology,
      and I think we might omit Margot and pass straight to reading some
      author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he explained to the French girl how grown-up people learn languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wanting to learn modern languages, laid
      before him the French, German, and Latin gospels, and read them side by
      side, carefully analysing each word, and would you believe it, he attained
      his object in less than a year. Let us do the same. We&rsquo;ll take some author
      and read him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French girl looked at him in perplexity. Evidently the suggestion
      seemed to her very naïve and ridiculous. If this strange proposal had been
      made to her by a child, she would certainly have been angry and have
      scolded it, but as he was a grown-up man and very stout and she could not
      scold him, she only shrugged her shoulders hardly perceptibly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vorotov rummaged in his bookcase and picked out a dog&rsquo;s-eared French book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will this do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case let us begin, and good luck to it! Let&rsquo;s begin with the
      title . . . &lsquo;Mémoires.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo; Mdlle. Enquête translated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a good-natured smile, breathing hard, he spent a quarter of an hour
      over the word &ldquo;Mémoires,&rdquo; and as much over the word <i>de</i>, and this
      wearied the young lady. She answered his questions languidly, grew
      confused, and evidently did not understand her pupil well, and did not
      attempt to understand him. Vorotov asked her questions, and at the same
      time kept looking at her fair hair and thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her hair isn&rsquo;t naturally curly; she curls it. It&rsquo;s a strange thing! She
      works from morning to night, and yet she has time to curl her hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock precisely she got up, and saying coldly and dryly, &ldquo;Au
      revoir, monsieur,&rdquo; walked out of the study, leaving behind her the same
      tender, delicate, disturbing fragrance. For a long time again her pupil
      did nothing; he sat at the table meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days that followed he became convinced that his teacher was a
      charming, conscientious, and precise young lady, but that she was very
      badly educated, and incapable of teaching grown-up people, and he made up
      his mind not to waste his time, to get rid of her, and to engage another
      teacher. When she came the seventh time he took out of his pocket an
      envelope with seven roubles in it, and holding it in his hand, became very
      confused and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Alice Osipovna, but I ought to tell you . . . I&rsquo;m under
      painful necessity . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the envelope, the French girl guessed what was meant, and for the
      first time during their lessons her face quivered and her cold,
      business-like expression vanished. She coloured a little, and dropping her
      eyes, began nervously fingering her slender gold chain. And Vorotov,
      seeing her perturbation, realised how much a rouble meant to her, and how
      bitter it would be to her to lose what she was earning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to tell you,&rdquo; he muttered, growing more and more confused, and
      quavering inwardly; he hurriedly stuffed the envelope into his pocket and
      went on: &ldquo;Excuse me, I . . . I must leave you for ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And trying to appear as though he had not in the least meant to get rid of
      her, but only to ask her permission to leave her for a short time, he went
      into the next room and sat there for ten minutes. And then he returned
      more embarrassed than ever: it struck him that she might have interpreted
      his brief absence in some way of her own, and he felt awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lessons began again. Yorotov felt no interest in them. Realising that
      he would gain nothing from the lessons, he gave the French girl liberty to
      do as she liked, asking her nothing and not interrupting her. She
      translated away as she pleased ten pages during a lesson, and he did not
      listen, breathed hard, and having nothing better to do, gazed at her curly
      head, or her soft white hands or her neck and sniffed the fragrance of her
      clothes. He caught himself thinking very unsuitable thoughts, and felt
      ashamed, or he was moved to tenderness, and then he felt vexed and wounded
      that she was so cold and business-like with him, and treated him as a
      pupil, never smiling and seeming afraid that he might accidentally touch
      her. He kept wondering how to inspire her with confidence and get to know
      her better, and to help her, to make her understand how badly she taught,
      poor thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mdlle. Enquête came to the lesson in a smart pink dress, slightly
      <i>décolleté</i>, and surrounded by such a fragrance that she seemed to be
      wrapped in a cloud, and, if one blew upon her, ready to fly away into the
      air or melt away like smoke. She apologised and said she could stay only
      half an hour for the lesson, as she was going straight from the lesson to
      a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her throat and the back of her bare neck, and thought he
      understood why Frenchwomen had the reputation of frivolous creatures
      easily seduced; he was carried away by this cloud of fragrance, beauty,
      and bare flesh, while she, unconscious of his thoughts and probably not in
      the least interested in them, rapidly turned over the pages and translated
      at full steam:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He was walking the street and meeting a gentleman his friend and saying,
      &ldquo;Where are you striving to seeing your face so pale it makes me sad.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Mémoires&rdquo; had long been finished, and now Alice was translating some
      other book. One day she came an hour too early for the lesson, apologizing
      and saying that she wanted to leave at seven and go to the Little Theatre.
      Seeing her out after the lesson, Vorotov dressed and went to the theatre
      himself. He went, and fancied that he was going simply for change and
      amusement, and that he was not thinking about Alice at all. He could not
      admit that a serious man, preparing for a learned career, lethargic in his
      habits, could fling up his work and go to the theatre simply to meet there
      a girl he knew very little, who was unintelligent and utterly
      unintellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet for some reason his heart was beating during the intervals, and
      without realizing what he was doing, he raced about the corridors and
      foyer like a boy impatiently looking for some one, and he was disappointed
      when the interval was over. And when he saw the familiar pink dress and
      the handsome shoulders under the tulle, his heart quivered as though with
      a foretaste of happiness; he smiled joyfully, and for the first time in
      his life experienced the sensation of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was walking with two unattractive-looking students and an officer.
      She was laughing, talking loudly, and obviously flirting. Vorotov had
      never seen her like that. She was evidently happy, contented, warm,
      sincere. What for? Why? Perhaps because these men were her friends and
      belonged to her own circle. And Vorotov felt there was a terrible gulf
      between himself and that circle. He bowed to his teacher, but she gave him
      a chilly nod and walked quickly by; she evidently did not care for her
      friends to know that she had pupils, and that she had to give lessons to
      earn money.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meeting at the theatre Vorotov realised that he was in love. . .
      . During the subsequent lessons he feasted his eyes on his elegant
      teacher, and without struggling with himself, gave full rein to his
      imaginations, pure and impure. Mdlle. Enquête&rsquo;s face did not cease to be
      cold; precisely at eight o&rsquo;clock every evening she said coldly, &ldquo;Au
      revoir, monsieur,&rdquo; and he felt she cared nothing about him, and never
      would care anything about him, and that his position was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes in the middle of a lesson he would begin dreaming, hoping,
      making plans. He inwardly composed declarations of love, remembered that
      Frenchwomen were frivolous and easily won, but it was enough for him to
      glance at the face of his teacher for his ideas to be extinguished as a
      candle is blown out when you bring it into the wind on the verandah. Once,
      overcome, forgetting himself as though in delirium, he could not restrain
      himself, and barred her way as she was going from the study into the entry
      after the lesson, and, gasping for breath and stammering, began to declare
      his love:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dear to me! I . . . I love you! Allow me to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Alice turned pale&mdash;probably from dismay, reflecting that after
      this declaration she could not come here again and get a rouble a lesson.
      With a frightened look in her eyes she said in a loud whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, you mustn&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t speak, I entreat you! You mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Vorotov did not sleep all night afterwards; he was tortured by shame;
      he blamed himself and thought intensely. It seemed to him that he had
      insulted the girl by his declaration, that she would not come to him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved to find out her address from the address bureau in the
      morning, and to write her a letter of apology. But Alice came without a
      letter. For the first minute she felt uncomfortable, then she opened a
      book and began briskly and rapidly translating as usual:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, young gentleman, don&rsquo;t tear those flowers in my garden which I want
      to be giving to my ill daughter. . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still comes to this day. Four books have already been translated, but
      Vorotov knows no French but the word &ldquo;Mémoires,&rdquo; and when he is asked
      about his literary researches, he waves his hand, and without answering,
      turns the conversation to the weather.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> CARRIAGE with
      four fine sleek horses drove in at the big so-called Red Gate of the N&mdash;-
      Monastery. While it was still at a distance, the priests and monks who
      were standing in a group round the part of the hostel allotted to the
      gentry, recognised by the coachman and horses that the lady in the
      carriage was Princess Vera Gavrilovna, whom they knew very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man in livery jumped off the box and helped the princess to get out
      of the carriage. She raised her dark veil and moved in a leisurely way up
      to the priests to receive their blessing; then she nodded pleasantly to
      the rest of the monks and went into the hostel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you missed your princess?&rdquo; she said to the monk who brought in
      her things. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whole month since I&rsquo;ve been to see you. But here I am;
      behold your princess. And where is the Father Superior? My goodness, I am
      burning with impatience! Wonderful, wonderful old man! You must be proud
      of having such a Superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Father Superior came in, the princess uttered a shriek of
      delight, crossed her arms over her bosom, and went up to receive his
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, let me kiss your hand,&rdquo; she said, snatching it and eagerly
      kissing it three times. &ldquo;How glad I am to see you at last, holy Father!
      I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve forgotten your princess, but my thoughts have been in your
      dear monastery every moment. How delightful it is here! This living for
      God far from the busy, giddy world has a special charm of its own, holy
      Father, which I feel with my whole soul although I cannot express it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess&rsquo;s cheeks glowed and tears came into her eyes. She talked
      incessantly, fervently, while the Father Superior, a grave, plain, shy old
      man of seventy, remained mute or uttered abruptly, like a soldier on duty,
      phrases such as:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Your Excellency. . . . Quite so. I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Your Excellency come for a long stay?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay the night here, and to-morrow I&rsquo;m going on to Klavdia
      Nikolaevna&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen her&mdash;and the day
      after to-morrow I&rsquo;ll come back to you and stay three or four days. I want
      to rest my soul here among you, holy Father. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess liked being at the monastery at N&mdash;-. For the last two
      years it had been a favourite resort of hers; she used to go there almost
      every month in the summer and stay two or three days, even sometimes a
      week. The shy novices, the stillness, the low ceilings, the smell of
      cypress, the modest fare, the cheap curtains on the windows&mdash;all this
      touched her, softened her, and disposed her to contemplation and good
      thoughts. It was enough for her to be half an hour in the hostel for her
      to feel that she, too, was timid and modest, and that she, too, smelt of
      cypress-wood. The past retreated into the background, lost its
      significance, and the princess began to imagine that in spite of her
      twenty-nine years she was very much like the old Father Superior, and
      that, like him, she was created not for wealth, not for earthly grandeur
      and love, but for a peaceful life secluded from the world, a life in
      twilight like the hostel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happens that a ray of light gleams in the dark cell of the anchorite
      absorbed in prayer, or a bird alights on the window and sings its song;
      the stern anchorite will smile in spite of himself, and a gentle, sinless
      joy will pierce through the load of grief over his sins, like water
      flowing from under a stone. The princess fancied she brought from the
      outside world just such comfort as the ray of light or the bird. Her gay,
      friendly smile, her gentle eyes, her voice, her jests, her whole
      personality in fact, her little graceful figure always dressed in simple
      black, must arouse in simple, austere people a feeling of tenderness and
      joy. Every one, looking at her, must think: &ldquo;God has sent us an angel. . .
      .&rdquo; And feeling that no one could help thinking this, she smiled still more
      cordially, and tried to look like a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      After drinking tea and resting, she went for a walk. The sun was already
      setting. From the monastery garden came a moist fragrance of freshly
      watered mignonette, and from the church floated the soft singing of men&rsquo;s
      voices, which seemed very pleasant and mournful in the distance. It was
      the evening service. In the dark windows where the little lamps glowed
      gently, in the shadows, in the figure of the old monk sitting at the
      church door with a collecting-box, there was such unruffled peace that the
      princess felt moved to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the gate, in the walk between the wall and the birch-trees where
      there were benches, it was quite evening. The air grew rapidly darker and
      darker. The princess went along the walk, sat on a seat, and sank into
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought how good it would be to settle down for her whole life in this
      monastery where life was as still and unruffled as a summer evening; how
      good it would be to forget the ungrateful, dissipated prince; to forget
      her immense estates, the creditors who worried her every day, her
      misfortunes, her maid Dasha, who had looked at her impertinently that
      morning. It would be nice to sit here on the bench all her life and watch
      through the trunks of the birch-trees the evening mist gathering in
      wreaths in the valley below; the rooks flying home in a black cloud like a
      veil far, far away above the forest; two novices, one astride a piebald
      horse, another on foot driving out the horses for the night and rejoicing
      in their freedom, playing pranks like little children; their youthful
      voices rang out musically in the still air, and she could distinguish
      every word. It is nice to sit and listen to the silence: at one moment the
      wind blows and stirs the tops of the birch-trees, then a frog rustles in
      last year&rsquo;s leaves, then the clock on the belfry strikes the quarter. . .
      . One might sit without moving, listen and think, and think. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman passed by with a wallet on her back. The princess thought
      that it would be nice to stop the old woman and to say something friendly
      and cordial to her, to help her. . . . But the old woman turned the corner
      without once looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long afterwards a tall man with a grey beard and a straw hat came
      along the walk. When he came up to the princess, he took off his hat and
      bowed. From the bald patch on his head and his sharp, hooked nose the
      princess recognised him as the doctor, Mihail Ivanovitch, who had been in
      her service at Dubovki. She remembered that some one had told her that his
      wife had died the year before, and she wanted to sympathise with him, to
      console him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, I expect you don&rsquo;t recognise me?&rdquo; she said with an affable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Princess, I recognised you,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking off his hat
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you; I was afraid that you, too, had forgotten your princess.
      People only remember their enemies, but they forget their friends. Have
      you, too, come to pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the doctor here, and I have to spend the night at the monastery
      every Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how are you?&rdquo; said the princess, sighing. &ldquo;I hear that you have
      lost your wife. What a calamity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Princess, for me it is a great calamity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it! We must bear our troubles with resignation. Not
      one hair of a man&rsquo;s head is lost without the Divine Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the princess&rsquo;s friendly, gentle smile and her sighs the doctor
      responded coldly and dryly: &ldquo;Yes, Princess.&rdquo; And the expression of his
      face was cold and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can I say to him?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long it is since we met!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Five years! How much water has
      flowed under the bridge, how many changes in that time; it quite frightens
      one to think of it! You know, I am married. . . . I am not a countess now,
      but a princess. And by now I am separated from my husband too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has sent me many trials. No doubt you have heard, too, that I am
      almost ruined. My Dubovki, Sofyino, and Kiryakovo have all been sold for
      my unhappy husband&rsquo;s debts. And I have only Baranovo and Mihaltsevo left.
      It&rsquo;s terrible to look back: how many changes and misfortunes of all kinds,
      how many mistakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Princess, many mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess was a little disconcerted. She knew her mistakes; they were
      all of such a private character that no one but she could think or speak
      of them. She could not resist asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mistakes are you thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You referred to them, so you know them . . .&rdquo; answered the doctor, and he
      smiled. &ldquo;Why talk about them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; tell me, doctor. I shall be very grateful to you. And please don&rsquo;t
      stand on ceremony with me. I love to hear the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not your judge, Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my judge! What a tone you take! You must know something about me.
      Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really wish it, very well. Only I regret to say I&rsquo;m not clever at
      talking, and people can&rsquo;t always understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor thought a moment and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of mistakes; but the most important of them, in my opinion, was the
      general spirit that prevailed on all your estates. You see, I don&rsquo;t know
      how to express myself. I mean chiefly the lack of love, the aversion for
      people that was felt in absolutely everything. Your whole system of life
      was built upon that aversion. Aversion for the human voice, for faces, for
      heads, steps . . . in fact, for everything that makes up a human being. At
      all the doors and on the stairs there stand sleek, rude, and lazy grooms
      in livery to prevent badly dressed persons from entering the house; in the
      hall there are chairs with high backs so that the footmen waiting there,
      during balls and receptions, may not soil the walls with their heads; in
      every room there are thick carpets that no human step may be heard; every
      one who comes in is infallibly warned to speak as softly and as little as
      possible, and to say nothing that might have a disagreeable effect on the
      nerves or the imagination. And in your room you don&rsquo;t shake hands with any
      one or ask him to sit down&mdash; just as you didn&rsquo;t shake hands with me
      or ask me to sit down. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, if you like,&rdquo; said the princess, smiling and holding out
      her hand. &ldquo;Really, to be cross about such trifles. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not cross,&rdquo; laughed the doctor, but at once he flushed, took off
      his hat, and waving it about, began hotly: &ldquo;To be candid, I&rsquo;ve long wanted
      an opportunity to tell you all I think. . . . That is, I want to tell you
      that you look upon the mass of mankind from the Napoleonic standpoint as
      food for the cannon. But Napoleon had at least some idea; you have nothing
      except aversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an aversion for people?&rdquo; smiled the princess, shrugging her
      shoulders in astonishment. &ldquo;I have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you! You want facts? By all means. In Mihaltsevo three former cooks
      of yours, who have gone blind in your kitchens from the heat of the stove,
      are living upon charity. All the health and strength and good looks that
      is found on your hundreds of thousands of acres is taken by you and your
      parasites for your grooms, your footmen, and your coachmen. All these
      two-legged cattle are trained to be flunkeys, overeat themselves, grow
      coarse, lose the &lsquo;image and likeness,&rsquo; in fact. . . . Young doctors,
      agricultural experts, teachers, intellectual workers generally&mdash;think
      of it!&mdash;are torn away from their honest work and forced for a crust
      of bread to take part in all sorts of mummeries which make every decent
      man feel ashamed! Some young men cannot be in your service for three years
      without becoming hypocrites, toadies, sneaks. . . . Is that a good thing?
      Your Polish superintendents, those abject spies, all those Kazimers and
      Kaetans, go hunting about on your hundreds of thousands of acres from
      morning to night, and to please you try to get three skins off one ox.
      Excuse me, I speak disconnectedly, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. You don&rsquo;t look
      upon the simple people as human beings. And even the princes, counts, and
      bishops who used to come and see you, you looked upon simply as decorative
      figures, not as living beings. But the worst of all, the thing that most
      revolts me, is having a fortune of over a million and doing nothing for
      other people, nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess sat amazed, aghast, offended, not knowing what to say or how
      to behave. She had never before been spoken to in such a tone. The
      doctor&rsquo;s unpleasant, angry voice and his clumsy, faltering phrases made a
      harsh clattering noise in her ears and her head. Then she began to feel as
      though the gesticulating doctor was hitting her on the head with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; she articulated softly, in an imploring voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done
      a great deal of good for other people; you know it yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Can you possibly go on thinking of your
      philanthropic work as something genuine and useful, and not a mere
      mummery? It was a farce from beginning to end; it was playing at loving
      your neighbour, the most open farce which even children and stupid peasant
      women saw through! Take for instance your&mdash; what was it called?&mdash;house
      for homeless old women without relations, of which you made me something
      like a head doctor, and of which you were the patroness. Mercy on us! What
      a charming institution it was! A house was built with parquet floors and a
      weathercock on the roof; a dozen old women were collected from the
      villages and made to sleep under blankets and sheets of Dutch linen, and
      given toffee to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave a malignant chuckle into his hat, and went on speaking
      rapidly and stammering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a farce! The attendants kept the sheets and the blankets under
      lock and key, for fear the old women should soil them&mdash;&lsquo;Let the old
      devil&rsquo;s pepper-pots sleep on the floor.&rsquo; The old women did not dare to sit
      down on the beds, to put on their jackets, to walk over the polished
      floors. Everything was kept for show and hidden away from the old women as
      though they were thieves, and the old women were clothed and fed on the
      sly by other people&rsquo;s charity, and prayed to God night and day to be
      released from their prison and from the canting exhortations of the sleek
      rascals to whose care you committed them. And what did the managers do? It
      was simply charming! About twice a week there would be thirty-five
      thousand messages to say that the princess&mdash;that is, you&mdash;were
      coming to the home next day. That meant that next day I had to abandon my
      patients, dress up and be on parade. Very good; I arrive. The old women,
      in everything clean and new, are already drawn up in a row, waiting. Near
      them struts the old garrison rat&mdash;the superintendent with his
      mawkish, sneaking smile. The old women yawn and exchange glances, but are
      afraid to complain. We wait. The junior steward gallops up. Half an hour
      later the senior steward; then the superintendent of the accounts&rsquo; office,
      then another, and then another of them . . . they keep arriving endlessly.
      They all have mysterious, solemn faces. We wait and wait, shift from one
      leg to another, look at the clock&mdash;all this in monumental silence
      because we all hate each other like poison. One hour passes, then a
      second, and then at last the carriage is seen in the distance, and . . .
      and . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went off into a shrill laugh and brought out in a shrill voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get out of the carriage, and the old hags, at the word of command
      from the old garrison rat, begin chanting: &lsquo;The Glory of our Lord in Zion
      the tongue of man cannot express. . .&rsquo; A pretty scene, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went off into a bass chuckle, and waved his hand as though to
      signify that he could not utter another word for laughing. He laughed
      heavily, harshly, with clenched teeth, as ill-natured people laugh; and
      from his voice, from his face, from his glittering, rather insolent eyes
      it could be seen that he had a profound contempt for the princess, for the
      home, and for the old women. There was nothing amusing or laughable in all
      that he described so clumsily and coarsely, but he laughed with
      satisfaction, even with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the school?&rdquo; he went on, panting from laughter. &ldquo;Do you remember how
      you wanted to teach peasant children yourself? You must have taught them
      very well, for very soon the children all ran away, so that they had to be
      thrashed and bribed to come and be taught. And you remember how you wanted
      to feed with your own hands the infants whose mothers were working in the
      fields. You went about the village crying because the infants were not at
      your disposal, as the mothers would take them to the fields with them.
      Then the village foreman ordered the mothers by turns to leave their
      infants behind for your entertainment. A strange thing! They all ran away
      from your benevolence like mice from a cat! And why was it? It&rsquo;s very
      simple. Not because our people are ignorant and ungrateful, as you always
      explained it to yourself, but because in all your fads, if you&rsquo;ll excuse
      the word, there wasn&rsquo;t a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of love and kindness! There was nothing
      but the desire to amuse yourself with living puppets, nothing else. . . .
      A person who does not feel the difference between a human being and a
      lap-dog ought not to go in for philanthropy. I assure you, there&rsquo;s a great
      difference between human beings and lap-dogs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess&rsquo;s heart was beating dreadfully; there was a thudding in her
      ears, and she still felt as though the doctor were beating her on the head
      with his hat. The doctor talked quickly, excitedly, and uncouthly,
      stammering and gesticulating unnecessarily. All she grasped was that she
      was spoken to by a coarse, ill-bred, spiteful, and ungrateful man; but
      what he wanted of her and what he was talking about, she could not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she said in a tearful voice, putting up her hands to protect
      her head from the doctor&rsquo;s hat; &ldquo;go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how you treat your servants!&rdquo; the doctor went on, indignantly. &ldquo;You
      treat them as the lowest scoundrels, and don&rsquo;t look upon them as human
      beings. For example, allow me to ask, why did you dismiss me? For ten
      years I worked for your father and afterwards for you, honestly, without
      vacations or holidays. I gained the love of all for more than seventy
      miles round, and suddenly one fine day I am informed that I am no longer
      wanted. What for? I&rsquo;ve no idea to this day. I, a doctor of medicine, a
      gentleman by birth, a student of the Moscow University, father of a family&mdash;am
      such a petty, insignificant insect that you can kick me out without
      explaining the reason! Why stand on ceremony with me! I heard afterwards
      that my wife went without my knowledge three times to intercede with you
      for me&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t receive her. I am told she cried in your hall.
      And I shall never forgive her for it, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused and clenched his teeth, making an intense effort to
      think of something more to say, very unpleasant and vindictive. He thought
      of something, and his cold, frowning face suddenly brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your attitude to this monastery!&rdquo; he said with avidity. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      never spared any one, and the holier the place, the more chance of its
      suffering from your loving-kindness and angelic sweetness. Why do you come
      here? What do you want with the monks here, allow me to ask you? What is
      Hecuba to you or you to Hecuba? It&rsquo;s another farce, another amusement for
      you, another sacrilege against human dignity, and nothing more. Why, you
      don&rsquo;t believe in the monks&rsquo; God; you&rsquo;ve a God of your own in your heart,
      whom you&rsquo;ve evolved for yourself at spiritualist séances. You look with
      condescension upon the ritual of the Church; you don&rsquo;t go to mass or
      vespers; you sleep till midday. . . . Why do you come here? . . . You come
      with a God of your own into a monastery you have nothing to do with, and
      you imagine that the monks look upon it as a very great honour. To be sure
      they do! You&rsquo;d better ask, by the way, what your visits cost the
      monastery. You were graciously pleased to arrive here this evening, and a
      messenger from your estate arrived on horseback the day before yesterday
      to warn them of your coming. They were the whole day yesterday getting the
      rooms ready and expecting you. This morning your advance-guard arrived&mdash;an
      insolent maid, who keeps running across the courtyard, rustling her
      skirts, pestering them with questions, giving orders. . . . I can&rsquo;t endure
      it! The monks have been on the lookout all day, for if you were not met
      with due ceremony, there would be trouble! You&rsquo;d complain to the bishop!
      &lsquo;The monks don&rsquo;t like me, your holiness; I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to
      displease them. It&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;m a great sinner, but I&rsquo;m so unhappy!&rsquo; Already
      one monastery has been in hot water over you. The Father Superior is a
      busy, learned man; he hasn&rsquo;t a free moment, and you keep sending for him
      to come to your rooms. Not a trace of respect for age or for rank! If at
      least you were a bountiful giver to the monastery, one wouldn&rsquo;t resent it
      so much, but all this time the monks have not received a hundred roubles
      from you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever people worried the princess, misunderstood her, or mortified her,
      and when she did not know what to say or do, she usually began to cry. And
      on this occasion, too, she ended by hiding her face in her hands and
      crying aloud in a thin treble like a child. The doctor suddenly stopped
      and looked at her. His face darkened and grew stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Princess,&rdquo; he said in a hollow voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given way to a
      malicious feeling and forgotten myself. It was not right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And coughing in an embarrassed way, he walked away quickly, without
      remembering to put his hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars were already twinkling in the sky. The moon must have been rising on
      the further side of the monastery, for the sky was clear, soft, and
      transparent. Bats were flitting noiselessly along the white monastery
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock slowly struck three quarters, probably a quarter to nine. The
      princess got up and walked slowly to the gate. She felt wounded and was
      crying, and she felt that the trees and the stars and even the bats were
      pitying her, and that the clock struck musically only to express its
      sympathy with her. She cried and thought how nice it would be to go into a
      monastery for the rest of her life. On still summer evenings she would
      walk alone through the avenues, insulted, injured, misunderstood by
      people, and only God and the starry heavens would see the martyr&rsquo;s tears.
      The evening service was still going on in the church. The princess stopped
      and listened to the singing; how beautiful the singing sounded in the
      still darkness! How sweet to weep and suffer to the sound of that singing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Going into her rooms, she looked at her tear-stained face in the glass and
      powdered it, then she sat down to supper. The monks knew that she liked
      pickled sturgeon, little mushrooms, Malaga and plain honey-cakes that left
      a taste of cypress in the mouth, and every time she came they gave her all
      these dishes. As she ate the mushrooms and drank the Malaga, the princess
      dreamed of how she would be finally ruined and deserted&mdash;how all her
      stewards, bailiffs, clerks, and maid-servants for whom she had done so
      much, would be false to her, and begin to say rude things; how people all
      the world over would set upon her, speak ill of her, jeer at her. She
      would renounce her title, would renounce society and luxury, and would go
      into a convent without one word of reproach to any one; she would pray for
      her enemies&mdash;and then they would all understand her and come to beg
      her forgiveness, but by that time it would be too late. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper she knelt down in the corner before the ikon and read two
      chapters of the Gospel. Then her maid made her bed and she got into it.
      Stretching herself under the white quilt, she heaved a sweet, deep sigh,
      as one sighs after crying, closed her eyes, and began to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she waked up and glanced at her watch. It was half-past
      nine. On the carpet near the bed was a bright, narrow streak of sunlight
      from a ray which came in at the window and dimly lighted up the room.
      Flies were buzzing behind the black curtain at the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s early,&rdquo;
       thought the princess, and she closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretching and lying snug in her bed, she recalled her meeting yesterday
      with the doctor and all the thoughts with which she had gone to sleep the
      night before: she remembered she was unhappy. Then she thought of her
      husband living in Petersburg, her stewards, doctors, neighbours, the
      officials of her acquaintance . . . a long procession of familiar
      masculine faces passed before her imagination. She smiled and thought, if
      only these people could see into her heart and understand her, they would
      all be at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter past eleven she called her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me to dress, Dasha,&rdquo; she said languidly. &ldquo;But go first and tell them
      to get out the horses. I must set off for Klavdia Nikolaevna&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going out to get into the carriage, she blinked at the glaring daylight
      and laughed with pleasure: it was a wonderfully fine day! As she scanned
      from her half-closed eyes the monks who had gathered round the steps to
      see her off, she nodded graciously and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my friends! Till the day after tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an agreeable surprise to her that the doctor was with the monks by
      the steps. His face was pale and severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he said with a guilty smile, taking off his hat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      waiting here a long time to see you. Forgive me, for God&rsquo;s sake. . . . I
      was carried away yesterday by an evil, vindictive feeling and I talked . .
      . nonsense. In short, I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess smiled graciously, and held out her hand for him to kiss. He
      kissed it, turning red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying to look like a bird, the princess fluttered into the carriage and
      nodded in all directions. There was a gay, warm, serene feeling in her
      heart, and she felt herself that her smile was particularly soft and
      friendly. As the carriage rolled towards the gates, and afterwards along
      the dusty road past huts and gardens, past long trains of waggons and
      strings of pilgrims on their way to the monastery, she still screwed up
      her eyes and smiled softly. She was thinking there was no higher bliss
      than to bring warmth, light, and joy wherever one went, to forgive
      injuries, to smile graciously on one&rsquo;s enemies. The peasants she passed
      bowed to her, the carriage rustled softly, clouds of dust rose from under
      the wheels and floated over the golden rye, and it seemed to the princess
      that her body was swaying not on carriage cushions but on clouds, and that
      she herself was like a light, transparent little cloud. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy I am!&rdquo; she murmured, shutting her eyes. &ldquo;How happy I am!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE little town of
      B&mdash;&mdash;, consisting of two or three crooked streets, was sound
      asleep. There was a complete stillness in the motionless air. Nothing
      could be heard but far away, outside the town no doubt, the barking of a
      dog in a thin, hoarse tenor. It was close upon daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything had long been asleep. The only person not asleep was the young
      wife of Tchernomordik, a qualified dispenser who kept a chemist&rsquo;s shop at
      B&mdash;&mdash;. She had gone to bed and got up again three times, but
      could not sleep, she did not know why. She sat at the open window in her
      nightdress and looked into the street. She felt bored, depressed, vexed .
      . . so vexed that she felt quite inclined to cry&mdash;again she did not
      know why. There seemed to be a lump in her chest that kept rising into her
      throat. . . . A few paces behind her Tchernomordik lay curled up close to
      the wall, snoring sweetly. A greedy flea was stabbing the bridge of his
      nose, but he did not feel it, and was positively smiling, for he was
      dreaming that every one in the town had a cough, and was buying from him
      the King of Denmark&rsquo;s cough-drops. He could not have been wakened now by
      pinpricks or by cannon or by caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s shop was almost at the extreme end of the town, so that the
      chemist&rsquo;s wife could see far into the fields. She could see the eastern
      horizon growing pale by degrees, then turning crimson as though from a
      great fire. A big broad-faced moon peeped out unexpectedly from behind
      bushes in the distance. It was red (as a rule when the moon emerges from
      behind bushes it appears to be blushing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly in the stillness of the night there came the sounds of footsteps
      and a jingle of spurs. She could hear voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be the officers going home to the camp from the Police
      Captain&rsquo;s,&rdquo; thought the chemist&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards two figures wearing officers&rsquo; white tunics came into
      sight: one big and tall, the other thinner and shorter. . . . They
      slouched along by the fence, dragging one leg after the other and talking
      loudly together. As they passed the chemist&rsquo;s shop, they walked more
      slowly than ever, and glanced up at the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It smells like a chemist&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the thin one. &ldquo;And so it is! Ah, I
      remember. . . . I came here last week to buy some castor-oil. There&rsquo;s a
      chemist here with a sour face and the jawbone of an ass! Such a jawbone,
      my dear fellow! It must have been a jawbone like that Samson killed the
      Philistines with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;yes,&rdquo; said the big one in a bass voice. &ldquo;The pharmacist is asleep. And
      his wife is asleep too. She is a pretty woman, Obtyosov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her. I liked her very much. . . . Tell me, doctor, can she possibly
      love that jawbone of an ass? Can she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, most likely she does not love him,&rdquo; sighed the doctor, speaking as
      though he were sorry for the chemist. &ldquo;The little woman is asleep behind
      the window, Obtyosov, what? Tossing with the heat, her little mouth half
      open . . . and one little foot hanging out of bed. I bet that fool the
      chemist doesn&rsquo;t realise what a lucky fellow he is. . . . No doubt he sees
      no difference between a woman and a bottle of carbolic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, doctor,&rdquo; said the officer, stopping. &ldquo;Let us go into the shop and
      buy something. Perhaps we shall see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea&mdash;in the night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? They are obliged to serve one even at night. My dear fellow,
      let us go in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s wife, hiding behind the curtain, heard a muffled ring.
      Looking round at her husband, who was smiling and snoring sweetly as
      before, she threw on her dress, slid her bare feet into her slippers, and
      ran to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the glass door she could see two shadows. The
      chemist&rsquo;s wife turned up the lamp and hurried to the door to open it, and
      now she felt neither vexed nor bored nor inclined to cry, though her heart
      was thumping. The big doctor and the slender Obtyosov walked in. Now she
      could get a view of them. The doctor was corpulent and swarthy; he wore a
      beard and was slow in his movements. At the slightest motion his tunic
      seemed as though it would crack, and perspiration came on to his face. The
      officer was rosy, clean-shaven, feminine-looking, and as supple as an
      English whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may I give you?&rdquo; asked the chemist&rsquo;s wife, holding her dress across
      her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us . . . er-er . . . four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without haste the chemist&rsquo;s wife took down a jar from a shelf and began
      weighing out lozenges. The customers stared fixedly at her back; the
      doctor screwed up his eyes like a well-fed cat, while the lieutenant was
      very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a lady serving in a chemist&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo;
       observed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing out of the way in it,&rdquo; replied the chemist&rsquo;s wife,
      looking out of the corner of her eye at the rosy-cheeked officer. &ldquo;My
      husband has no assistant, and I always help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. . . . You have a charming little shop! What a number of
      different . . . jars! And you are not afraid of moving about among the
      poisons? Brrr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s wife sealed up the parcel and handed it to the doctor.
      Obtyosov gave her the money. Half a minute of silence followed. . . . The
      men exchanged glances, took a step towards the door, then looked at one
      another again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me two pennyworth of soda?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the chemist&rsquo;s wife slowly and languidly raised her hand to the
      shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you in the shop anything . . . such as . . .&rdquo; muttered Obtyosov,
      moving his fingers, &ldquo;something, so to say, allegorical . . . revivifying .
      . . seltzer-water, for instance. Have you any seltzer-water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the chemist&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! You&rsquo;re a fairy, not a woman! Give us three bottles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s wife hurriedly sealed up the soda and vanished through the
      door into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A peach!&rdquo; said the doctor, with a wink. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t find a pineapple
      like that in the island of Madeira! Eh? What do you say? Do you hear the
      snoring, though? That&rsquo;s his worship the chemist enjoying sweet repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A minute later the chemist&rsquo;s wife came back and set five bottles on the
      counter. She had just been in the cellar, and so was flushed and rather
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-sh! . . . quietly!&rdquo; said Obtyosov when, after uncorking the bottles,
      she dropped the corkscrew. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a noise; you&rsquo;ll wake your
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I do wake him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sleeping so sweetly . . . he must be dreaming of you. . . . To your
      health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; boomed the doctor, hiccupping after the seltzer-water,
      &ldquo;husbands are such a dull business that it would be very nice of them to
      be always asleep. How good a drop of red wine would be in this water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; laughed the chemist&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be splendid. What a pity they don&rsquo;t sell spirits in chemist&rsquo;s
      shops! Though you ought to sell wine as a medicine. Have you any <i>vinum
      gallicum rubrum</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, give us some! Bring it here, damn it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quantum satis</i>. . . . Give us an ounce each in the water, and
      afterwards we&rsquo;ll see. . . . Obtyosov, what do you say? First with water
      and afterwards <i>per se</i>. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and Obtyosov sat down to the counter, took off their caps, and
      began drinking the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wine, one must admit, is wretched stuff! <i>Vinum nastissimum!</i>
      Though in the presence of . . . er . . . it tastes like nectar. You are
      enchanting, madam! In imagination I kiss your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give a great deal to do so not in imagination,&rdquo; said Obtyosov.
      &ldquo;On my honour, I&rsquo;d give my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Madame Tchernomordik, flushing and assuming a
      serious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a flirt you are, though!&rdquo; the doctor laughed softly, looking slyly
      at her from under his brows. &ldquo;Your eyes seem to be firing shot: piff-paff!
      I congratulate you: you&rsquo;ve conquered! We are vanquished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s wife looked at their ruddy faces, listened to their chatter,
      and soon she, too, grew quite lively. Oh, she felt so gay! She entered
      into the conversation, she laughed, flirted, and even, after repeated
      requests from the customers, drank two ounces of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You officers ought to come in oftener from the camp,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      awful how dreary it is here. I&rsquo;m simply dying of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; said the doctor indignantly. &ldquo;Such a peach, a miracle
      of nature, thrown away in the wilds! How well Griboyedov said, &lsquo;Into the
      wilds, to Saratov&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s time for us to be off, though. Delighted to have
      made your acquaintance . . . very. How much do we owe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chemist&rsquo;s wife raised her eyes to the ceiling and her lips moved for
      some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve roubles forty-eight kopecks,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obtyosov took out of his pocket a fat pocket-book, and after fumbling for
      some time among the notes, paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband&rsquo;s sleeping sweetly . . . he must be dreaming,&rdquo; he muttered,
      pressing her hand at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear silly remarks. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What silly remarks? On the contrary, it&rsquo;s not silly at all . . . even
      Shakespeare said: &lsquo;Happy is he who in his youth is young.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go of my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last after much talk and after kissing the lady&rsquo;s hand at parting, the
      customers went out of the shop irresolutely, as though they were wondering
      whether they had not forgotten something.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran quickly into the bedroom and sat down in the same place. She saw
      the doctor and the officer, on coming out of the shop, walk lazily away a
      distance of twenty paces; then they stopped and began whispering together.
      What about? Her heart throbbed, there was a pulsing in her temples, and
      why she did not know. . . . Her heart beat violently as though those two
      whispering outside were deciding her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the doctor parted from Obtyosov and walked on, while
      Obtyosov came back. He walked past the shop once and a second time. . . .
      He would stop near the door and then take a few steps again. At last the
      bell tinkled discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Who is there?&rdquo; the chemist&rsquo;s wife heard her husband&rsquo;s voice
      suddenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ring at the bell, and you don&rsquo;t hear it,&rdquo; he said
      severely. &ldquo;Is that the way to do things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up, put on his dressing-gown, and staggering, half asleep, flopped
      in his slippers to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What . . . is it?&rdquo; he asked Obtyosov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me . . . give me four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sniffing continually, yawning, dropping asleep as he moved, and knocking
      his knees against the counter, the chemist went to the shelf and reached
      down the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later the chemist&rsquo;s wife saw Obtyosov go out of the shop, and,
      after he had gone some steps, she saw him throw the packet of peppermints
      on the dusty road. The doctor came from behind a corner to meet him. . . .
      They met and, gesticulating, vanished in the morning mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unhappy I am!&rdquo; said the chemist&rsquo;s wife, looking angrily at her
      husband, who was undressing quickly to get into bed again. &ldquo;Oh, how
      unhappy I am!&rdquo; she repeated, suddenly melting into bitter tears. &ldquo;And
      nobody knows, nobody knows. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot fourpence on the counter,&rdquo; muttered the chemist, pulling the
      quilt over him. &ldquo;Put it away in the till, please. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at once he fell asleep again.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
